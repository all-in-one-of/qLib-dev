Useful for generating center points for fractured geometry pieces.

It also supports generation of convenience attributes, which allow easy mapping between
group names and point indices (in both directions -- index-to-name and name-to-index lookup).

@Parameters
    Parameters:
        Group Mask:
            Primitive groups matching this mask will be treated as individual pieces. A single center point
            for each piece will be generated.

            TIP:
                The matched results are shown as guide geometry.
    
        Group Name Attribute:
            If enabled, a per-point string attribute is created that stores the group name for each centroid
            (this attribute is called `__origgrp`).
    
        Group Index Attribue:
            If enabled, it creates a detail attribute for each piece, where the attribute name is the same
            as the piece group name, and the value is the group index (same as the `__origpt` attribute from
            the [Node:sop/voronoifracture] SOP).
    
            NOTE:
                The name-to-index detail attributes (if created) can be used by the PrimGroup Add IDs qL
                SOP (providing much more reliable behaviour; see [Node:sop/primgroup_add_ids_ql]).

        Rest Position:
            Store centroid positions as their rest positions as well (`rest` attribute).

        Orientation Vectors:
            Generate aim and up vectors for the centroids (with default values.)

            None:
                No vectors are generated.
            N, up:
                Use the `N` (normal) and `up` attributes.
            v, up:
                Use the `v` (velocity) and `up` attributes.

        Aim, Up:
            Values for the aim and up vectors.

    Preview:
        These options are for providing visual feedback of the current settings -- they do _not_ affect
        actual geometry output.

        Preview Individual Pieces:
            If enabled, only a single piece is displayed as guide geometry.

        Piece to Display:
            Index number of the preview piece to display in individual piece preview mode.

        Center Pt Size:
            When previewing a single piece, its centroid is also displayed. This value specifies the
            centroid's size on display.

        Pieces Info:
            These fields show additional information (non-editable), such as the total number of pieces
            and the group name of the currently displayed piece.

            NOTE:
                You need to press ((MMB)) on the *Current Piece* field if you see an expression instead of
                a group name.

NOTE:
    Group order and centroid-pt (ie. output) order ALWAYS match -- if you find otherwise,
    please report as a BUG.
