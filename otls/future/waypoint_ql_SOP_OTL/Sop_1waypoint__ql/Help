"""Represents a 'waypoint' in a complex SOP network, where expensive intermediate results can be saved to disk and re-used."""

    - [Cache|Node:sop/cache]

If you have complex SOP networks with many nodes (such as large-scale RBD simulations), you probably want to
break down your network to a few logical units. A Waypoint SOP can represent the end of such a logical unit,
with the additional feature of being able to store it on disk (so it can be reused instead of recalculated).

NOTE:
    Waypointing is (conceptually) _not_ caching, although the underlining mechanism is similar
    (and obviously the SOP node can be used as a cache). It's more akin to 'baking' than caching.


*Conceptual differences between waypointing and caching*

- _Waypoint: a separator between large logical units_

    In really complex networks, the entire network consists of usually two or more large logical units.
    A waypoint marks the end of such a unit ('compartment').

- _Manual update: As workflow_

    When the user finished working on (or modifying) a large logical block of SOP nodes, she marks it
    by 'rendering' the related waypoint (possibly some downstream waypoints, too). Although this has
    to be done manually, this level of caretaking always has to happen in practice
    (it's also a good opportunity to compare with an earlier on-disk version, etc.)

- _Manual update: Breaks procedural behaviour_

    Caching is (supposed to be) automatic, waypointing is not.

    A consequence of manual updating is that it is easy for the geometry on disk to get out of
    sync with the state of the SOP network. This can be less of a problem if the waypoint represents the
    end results of a large logical SOP block (as mentioned above).

    On the other hand, a SOP network littered with Waypoint nodes _do_ turn into a nightmare quickly. So...

WARNING:
    This SOP introduces additional maintenance burdens to your SOP network --
    as soon as you start using waypoints, you'll have to ensure that the geometry on disk corresponds
    to the current state of the upstream network. This can be a source for
    many mistakes. _Use as few instances of this node as possible._


*Useful features*

- _Multiple inputs_

    Up to four inputs (0-3) can be connected. This can be used to write different variations of the same
    geometry (e.g. plain/subdivided, etc).

- _Takes_

    Takes allow to work with lower-quality settings (if possible) and only calculate with higher settings
    when writing the results to disk (e.g. when baking ambient occlusion to per-point colors, the sampling
    quality can be boosted for the disk version only).


@parameters

    Pass Through:
        If turned on, the Waypoint does nothing (behaves like a plain [Node:sop/switch] node).
        This is 'On' by default and needed to be turned off explicitly once the user performed a
        write-to-disk operation.

    Input Select:
        Up to four (0-3) inputs can be connected; the geometry from the specified input will be written
        to disk.

    Points Only:
        When writing sequences, only the first frame will contain the complete geometry.
        The other frames will store point data only. This is greatly reduce I/O and
        geometry performance (usually about 2x).

    Remove Attribs:
        Which attributes to remove from the 'points-only' files. (Groups are always removed.)
        The default is to remove all but `v` (velocity).

    Writer (tab):
        Geometry writing settings (see also [Geometry ROP|Node:out/geometry]).

        Render:
            Pressing this button will write the evaulated upstream network to disk.

        Render with Take:
            The upstream network will be evaluated using the specified Take.

        Output File:
            The path and filename of the geometry file. By default the geometry name is built
            from the Waypoint SOP name and the Input Select index.

    Reader (tab):
        Geometry reading settings (geometry file name is specified in
        the Output File field above -- see also [File SOP|Node:sop/file]).

        Reload Geometry:
            Pressing this button will (re)read the geometry file from disk.
            *This button has to be pressed every time the geometry file is overwritten.*
