    - [Node:sop/box]

The following are the differences from the original [Node:sop/box] SOP:

* The box is specified by two opposite corner points (face normals will always point outwards, regardless of corner positions).
* It also allows removing specified sides of the box.
* It provides two ways of specifying divisions.


NOTE:
    This SOP generates polygonal geometry only.



@Release_Notes
    Version 0.0.1:
        Initial release.
