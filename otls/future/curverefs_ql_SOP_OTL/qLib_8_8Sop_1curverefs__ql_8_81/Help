This SOP generates reference frames (a set of three vectors that defines a local coordinate system)
for all curve points.

The algorithm generates each reference frame incrementally from the previous one to avoid flipping.
This can be very useful where curves with 'on-curve orientation' information is needed
(such as motion paths or hair curves).

The method is based on the paper "Calculation of Reference Frames along a Space Curve" by Jules Bloomenthal
(Graphics Gems, vol. 1).

@Parameters
    Input:
        UV Attribute:
            A per-point UV attribute to build the reference frames from (only the U parameter is used).
            This attribute must be present (can be generated with an [Node:sop/texture] SOP).
    
        Up Vector Mode:
            The mode for determining the first up vector on each curve. It can either be a constant,
            or the up vector value of the first vertex can be used (if present).
    
        Up Vector:
            Vector value for the 'Constant' up vector mode.

    Output:
        Tangent:
            Name of the output tangent attribute (per-point vector).
        Normal:
            Name of the output normal (bi-tangent) attribute (per-point vector).
        Up:
            Name of the output up vector attribute (per-point vector).

TODO:
    Support selection ('group' parameter).
