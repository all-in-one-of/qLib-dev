The following queries are available:

Coincident Point Count:
    Finds out how many points occupy the same spatial coordinate.
    (Can be useful to detect un-[Fused|Node:sop/fuse] points.)
    Optionally, multiple coincident points can be grouped.

Neighbour Count:
    Determines the number of topological neighbours for each point
    (ie. connected with an edge).
    Optionally, points with small neighbour count (e.g. curve endpoints
    or "lonely" points) can be grouped.

Point Index, Vertex Index:
    Stores point or vertex indices in an attribute. The vertex index
    is relative to the primitive the point belongs to.

...

NOTE:
    Most vertex-related indices make more sense on curves or surfaces
    (they can be ambiguous on polygonal meshes).
