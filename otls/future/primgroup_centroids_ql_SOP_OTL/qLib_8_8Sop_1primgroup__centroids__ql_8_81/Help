*Version 0.0.3*

"""Builds a point cloud, where each point represents a centroid of a primitive group ('PrimGroup family' SOP)."""

Useful for generating center points for fractured geometry pieces.

It also supports:

* Generation of convenience attributes, which allow easy mapping between group names and point indices (in both directions -- index-to-name and name-to-index lookup).

* Measuring the geometry area/volume of each primitive group and storing the results on the center points. This allows using more advanced techniques, for instance to...

    * ... apply different dynamic properties (friction, mass, etc.) for differently-sized pieces
    * ... use RBD dynamics on "large" pieces and particle simulation for "small" ones
    * etc.


@Parameters

    Mode:
        Mode for detecting each geometry fracture (by primitive groups or name attribute).

    Group Mask:
        Primitive groups matching this mask will be treated as individual pieces. A single center point
        for each piece will be generated.

        TIP:
            The matched results are shown as guide geometry.

    Attrib Name:
        Name of the attribute used to determine the geometry pieces.

    Tolerance:
        A tolerance value name attribute values (in case it contains numerical values, e.g. fracture indices).
        Values that differ less than the tolerance are considered equal.

    Add Attributes:
        Group Indexing:
            Group Name Attribute:
                If enabled, a per-point string attribute is created that stores the group name for each centroid
                (this attribute is called `__origgrp`).
        
            Group Index Attribue:
                If enabled, it creates a detail attribute for each piece, where the attribute name is the same
                as the piece group name, and the value is the group index (same as the `__origpt` attribute from
                the [Node:sop/voronoifracture] SOP).
        
                NOTE:
                    The name-to-index detail attributes (if created) can be used by the PrimGroup Add IDs qL
                    SOP (providing much more reliable behaviour; see [Node:sop/primgroup_add_ids_ql]).

        Measure Pieces:
                Various geometric [measurements|Node:sop/measure] of each primitive group can be performed, and the
                results stored in the given point attribute(s) on the centroid that belongs to the primgroup.

            Surface Area:
                Measure the geometric surface area of each primitive group. The result is stored on the
                corresponding centroid points (as a float attribute with the specified name).

            Volume:
                Measure the volume of each primitive group. The result is stored on the
                corresponding centroid points (as a float attribute with the specified name).

        Transformation Related:    
            Rest Position:
                Store centroid positions as their rest positions as well (`rest` attribute).
        
            Orientation Vectors:
                Generate aim and up vectors for the centroids (with default values.)
        
                None:
                    No vectors are generated.
                N, up:
                    Use the `N` (normal) and `up` attributes.
                v, up:
                    Use the `v` (velocity) and `up` attributes.
        
            Aim, Up:
                Values for the aim and up vectors.

    Preview:
        These options are for providing visual feedback of the current settings -- they do _not_ affect
        actual geometry output.

        Preview Individual Pieces:
            If enabled, only a single piece is displayed as guide geometry.

        Piece to Display:
            Index number of the preview piece to display in individual piece preview mode.

        Center Pt Size:
            When previewing a single piece, its centroid is also displayed. This value specifies the
            centroid's size on display.

        Pieces Info:
            These fields show additional information (non-editable), such as the total number of pieces
            and the group name of the currently displayed piece.

            NOTE:
                You need to press ((MMB)) on the *Current Piece* field if you see an expression instead of
                a group name.


---

NOTE:
    Group order and centroid-pt (ie. output) order should ALWAYS match -- if you find otherwise,
    please report as a BUG.
