*Version 0.0.2*

"""An enhanced version of the original [Node:sop/timeblend] node."""

This version of the TimeBlend SOP supports the following additional features:

* Support for sub-frame samples: some file formats like Alembic can support multiple geometry samples per frame. This SOP can properly utilize sub-frame samples.

* Support extrapolation of dying particles (motion of particles at the end of their lifespan will be extrapolated using their velocity vectors).

TIP:
    When dealing with cached geometry ([Node:sop/cache] or [Node:sop/file] SOP, etc.), be aware that the
    `$F` variable is _rounded_ (it will be rounded _up to the next frame_ for subframe 0.5 and higher).

    To get the nearest whole frame number use an expression like `floor($FF)`.


@Parameters
    Sample Slice Size:
        The step between each frame sample in the incoming geometry. The slice size can be calculated using
        the formula  *_1 / <no. of samples per frame>_* .

        E.g.: the value for 20 samples per frame is _1 / 20 ==_ `0.05`.

        This can be useful for file formats that can store multiple samples for each frame (e.g. Alembic).

        Do _not_ adjust this value for regular File or Cache sequences.

    Time Blend:
        See [the original TimeBlend SOP help|Node:sop/timeblend] for the parameter descriptions.
    
    Particles:

        The functions below are useful when applying "slo-mo"-like effects on particles.

        Interpolate Dying Particles:
            Positions of particles not present in the following geometry sample (ie. on the next frame)
            will be extrapolated along their velocity vectors.
    
        Add Near-Death Attribute:
            Adds an attribute (float) that stores the phase of the velocity extrapolation for dying particles.

            (In other words, it can be used to determine how close is a dying particle to actual death.)

            TIP:
                This can be useful for fadeout-like effects on heavily slo-mo'd particles.

        Attribute Name:
            Attribute to store the near-death phase values to.

        Close-to-Life Value:
            Particles that just started dying (i.e. will not exist in the next geometry sample) will have this
            value. (Non-dying particles assume this value as well.)

        Close-to-Death Value:
            The particle will reach this value at the time of its death (at the end of its velocity-extrapolated
            sample).

            All dying particles will have their values blended between the _close-to-life_ and _-death_ values accordingly.

        TIP:
            To scale particles to non-existence, use `pscale` as the Near-Death Attribute, and `1.0` for near-life
            and `0.0` for near-death values.


TODO:
    Implement a way to interpolate any specified per-point attribute.
