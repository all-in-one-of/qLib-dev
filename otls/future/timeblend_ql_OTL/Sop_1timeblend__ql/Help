*Version 0.0.1*

"""An enhanced version of the original [Node:sop/timeblend] node."""

This version of the TimeBlend SOP supports the following additional features:

* Support for sub-frame samples: some file formats like Alembic can support multiple geometry samples per frame. The original TimeBlend node ignores these.

* Support extrapolation of dying particles (particles that exist for the last frame will be interpolated along their velocity vectors.)

@Parameters
    Sample Slice Size:
        The step between each frame sample in the incoming geometry. The slice size can be calculated using
        the _1.0 / <no.of samples per frame>_ formula (e.g. the value for 20 samples per frame is
        1.0/20 == *0.05* ).

        This can be useful for file formats that can store multiple samples for each frame (e.g. Alembic).


    Interpolate Dying Particles:
        Particles that are not present on the next frame (or sample) will be interpolated using their velocity
        vectors on the last frame.


See the original [Node:sop/timeblend] help for description of the other parameters.
