*Version 1*

"""Creates a new attribute by mapping a point attribute to a ramp."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the operator affects.
    Input Attribute:
        Name of the attribute that drives the mapping.
    Output Attribute:
        Name of the attribute that stores the result of the mapping.
    Input Min/Max:
        Minimum and maximum values of the input that fit to the start end end of the ramp.
    Operation:
        Type of operation. The original value of the output attribute can be *added*, *multiplied* or be *replaced*
        with the result.
    Signature:
        Signature of the output attribute.
    Color Mode:
        Color mode of the ramp.
    Ramp:
        The ramp that gets mapped.
    Exponent:
        Exponent of a power operation that allows you to make a gamma correction of the output.

WARNING:
    Changing the color of a ramp point doesn't trigger the parameter callback script that syncronizes the HSV and
    RGB ramps. To cirvumvent this please move the position sliders back and forth a bit before changing color modes.
    This is a bug of Houdini.
