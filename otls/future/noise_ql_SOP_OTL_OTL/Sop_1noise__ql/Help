*Version 0.1.0*

"""Modulates an attribute - possibly P - by a noise."""

TIP:
    The Noise qL SOP is implemented as a single VOP SOP, so you can map most of the parameters to attributes to further
    enhance the result. 

@Parameters
    Point Goup:
        Point group that gets affected by the deformer.
    Driver Attribute:
        Vector attribute that drives the noise generation.
    Target Attribute:
        Attribute that is modulated by the noise.
    Signature:
        Signature of the target attribute. Currently _float_ and _vector_ types are supported as the output.
    Mode:
        Target mode.
        * *Replace*: replaces the incoming value with the generated noise.
        * *Add*: adds the generated noise to the target attribute's incoming value.
        * *Multiply*: multiply the incoming value with the generated noise.
    Weight Attribute:
        Attribute that can _mask_ the modulation.
    Amount:
        Global multiplier of the modulation.
    Noise Parameters:
        If not otherwise indicated these are the exposed parameters of the underlying
        [Unified Noise VOP|Node:vop/unifiednoise]. See details there.
    Exponent:
        Sign-safe exponent applied after noise generation, which doesn't offset the result.
