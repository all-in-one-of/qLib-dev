"""A convenience operator for geometry wrapping."""

This node projects ("wraps") the input geometry to another by applying a series of ray/smooth operation pairs.

When wrapping one geometry to another, the most frequently used functions are
the [Ray SOP|Node:sop/ray] for doing the wrapping itself,
and the [Smooth SOP|Node:sop/smooth] to even out irregularities such as overlapping or twisted
polygons -- often using multiple nodes to achieve the desired results.

This node offers an alternative to the manual labour of building such networks.
The number of wrapping passes can be user-defined, and all operations have on/off switches so all individual
changes can be easily checked visually. Wrapping can be done quickly and more interactively.



@parameters
    Iterations:
        The number of wrapping operations to be performed.

    :
        Pass #:
            Enable/disable switch for one pass (ray/smooth pair).

        Ray:
            Amount (or 'weight') of the Ray operation (where `0` means keeping the original
            geometry shape, and `1` is the shape completely projected onto the wrapper
            geometry.)

        Smoothing:
            Number of smoothing steps.

        Cutoff Frequency:
            Noise frequency to remove. The larger this value, the more it will keep the original shape of the geometry.
