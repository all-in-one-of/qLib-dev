*Version 0.1.1*

"""Performs common operations between two vector attributes and/or constants."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the deformer affects.
    Operation:
        The operation to be executed.
    Blend:
        The mix bias when the operation is mix.
    Vector:
        Type of vector A/B.
    Normalize:
        Normalize vector A/B.
    Compute Normal A/B:
        Generate normal vectors for the first input.
    Attrib Name A/B:
        The name of the vector attribute of A/B. If the second input is not connected the attribute is read from the
        first input.
    Constant A/B:
        The constant value of A/B.
    Normalize Out:
        Normalize the output vector.
    Scale:
        Scale factor for the output vector.
    Invert Out:
        Negate the output vector.
    Out Attribute:
        The name and toggle of the target attribute of the vector operation result.
    Length Attrib:
        Name and toggle for the length of the result vector. The normalization of the output is skpipped for the length
        calculation, while scaling is not.
    Dot Product Attrib:
        Name and toggle for the dot product of the two input vectors.
    Angle Attrib:
        Name and toggle for the angle between the result vectors.
    Angle In Degrees:
        Output angle in degrees instead of radians.

@Release_Notes
