"""Applies the full world-space transformation of another object to the input geometry."""

(advanced; fundamental)

    - [Node:sop/xform]
    - [Node:sop/object_merge]


This node applies the world space transformation of the specified object (OBJ) node to
the input geometry. (This is the transformation that transforms geometry from the world
space origin to its current location.) It's also possible to apply the _inverse_ of
this transformation.

Transformation to/from the world space origin is also supported. To access it, choose
"`World Origin`" from the pop-down menu of the `Transform Object` parameter.

(For example: applying the World Origin transformation to a SOP geometry will place it at
the world origin, regardless of whatever transforms it has on its container OBJ node.)


@Parameters
    Transform Object:
        Path to the OBJ node (object) to get the transformation from.

        Choose "`World Origin`" from the pop-down menu to get the transformation to/from
        the world space origin.

    Apply:
        Enable/disable transformation.

    Invert:
        Reverts the direction of the transformation (e.g. "world origin" means
        "current space to world origin"; its inverse means "world origin to current space".)
