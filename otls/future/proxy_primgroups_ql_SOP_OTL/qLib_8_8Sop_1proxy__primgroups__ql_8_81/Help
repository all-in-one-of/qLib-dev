"""Creates a proxy version of each primitive group by wrapping a low resolution proxy around them (PrimGroup family SOP)."""

    - [PrimGroup SDF qL|Node:sop/primgroup_sdf_ql]

Useful for (and designed to) replace higher-resolution geometry fractures in RBD simulations,
if the results doesn't have to be too accurate (e.g. lots of fast-moving debris).

By default all per-primitive and per-point attributes are transferred to the proxies and
the appropriate geometry groups are recreated.

The resulting groups can be used in DOP networks and their results can be imported back with
the usual DOP Import SOP node.

(TODO: create an example scene and make sure prim groups are in proper order, etc. --
in other words, do a test round.)

@parameters

    Mode:
        Mode for detecting each geometry fracture (by primitive groups or name attribute).

    Group Mask:
        Geometry groups matching this mask will be replaced with proxies.

    Attrib Name:
        Name of the attribute used to determine the geometry pieces.

    Tolerance:
        A tolerance value name attribute values (in case it contains numerical values, e.g. fracture indices).
        Values that differ less than the tolerance are considered equal.

    Proxy Geometry:
        Settings for generation of an initial proxy shape.

        Proxy Type:
            Base geometry type for the low-res proxy.

            Sphere:
                Sphere-based (use the `frequency` parameter to set resolution).
            Box:
                Box-based (use the `divisions` parameters to set resolution).
            Custom:
                Custom geometry (2nd input)
    
        Post-Fit Scale:
            The proxy geometry is first fitted around the bounding box of the
            current primitive group. Then an uniform scale is performed, using
            this value.

    Wrapping:
        Wrapping the initial shape around the original geometry.

        Do Wrapping:
            Wrap the proxy around the original shape.
        Scale:
            Blend between plain bounding box (`0.0`) and full wrapping (`1.0`).
        Lift:
            Additional offset in surface normal direction.

    Attribute Transfer:
        Transfering of geometry attributes to the proxy geometry (enabled by default).
        See [Node:sop/attribtransfer] for the parameter details.

    Postprocessing:
        An optional smoothing of the proxy results.
        See [Node:sop/smooth] for the parameter details.
