This SOP can be used to generate SDFs of different resolutions for multiple primitive groups (pieces)
of a geometry -- based on the size of each piece. These SDFs can then be used in DOP networks
(e.g. for RBD fractured object).

This allows varying the SDF resolution on pieces of an RBD fractured object. Using less resolution
for smaller pieces means using less memory.


@parameters
    Group Mask:
        Primitive groups matching this mask will be used.

    Prefix:
        Prefix for the created volume primitives (one for each primitive group).

    Mode:
        How to determine the resolution for each volume.

        Same Num of Divisions:
            Use the same number of divisions for all volumes. (All volumes will have the same resolution.)
        Same-Sized Divisions:
            Use the same division size for all volumes. (Larger volumes will have more divisions.)
        Divisions Based on Object Sizes:
            Minimum/maximum object sizes and their corresponding number of divisions can be set explicitly.
            (See parameters below.)
        BBox Preview (Colored Object Sizes):
            This mode provides visual aid for setting up the appropriate min/max values for the previous
            mode. 

            ...

    Geo Size Min/Max:
            Minimum and maximum object sizes.

    Divisions Min/Max:
            The corresponding volume divisions for the minimum/maximum geometry sizes.

            ...


    Output Type:
        Type of the generated volumes. (Use SDF for RBD collision volumes).

    Create Output Groups:
        Create a primitive group for each volume, with the same name (this makes matching
        of RBDs and the volumes easier at the dopnet end).

    Isosurface Display Mode:
        Set display mode of the volumes to `Isosurface` (to see volume resolutions in
        wireframe modes).




TODO:
    Add implicit box, sphere modes.
