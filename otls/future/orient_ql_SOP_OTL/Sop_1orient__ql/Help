"""Converts between different representations of per-point orientation (rotation)."""

In Houdini there is more than one way to represent orientation (i.e. rotation) on a per-point basis.
This node allows to easily convert between these representations. The following methods are supported:

Aim / up vector pairs:
    Rotation on each point is represented by two vectors. The aim vector is usually `N` (normal)
    or `v` (velocity). The up vector should always be named `up`.

Orient (quaternion) attribute:
    A single per-point quaternion (vector4) attribute called `orient` stores the rotation for each point.
    This is more efficient but not 'human-friendly'.


Both ways are supported throughout Houdini wherever per-point orientation is needed (e.g. particle instancing,
Copy SOP, etc).

If vectors and quaternions are both present, _quaternions take preference_.


@Parameters
    Operation:
        Main operation settings.

        Operation:
            Main operation mode.

            Construct:
                Build `orient` attribute from vector pairs.

            Extract:
                Extract vector pairs from the `orient` attribute.

        Aim Vector:
            Name of the vector attribute that represents the aim direction for each point.
            It is usually `N` (normal) or `v` (velocity).

        Up Vector:
            Name of the per-point up vector attribute (by default it's called `up`).

        Orient Attribute:
            Attribute representing per-point orientation (in a quaternion form).
            The Houdini-supported attribute name is `orient` (type `vector4`).

        Delete Source Attribute(s):
            When converting to orient this will delete the vector pairs, and vice versa.


    Extract:
        These parameters are used when quaternion orientations are
        extracted back to aim/up vector pairs.

        Initial Aim:
            The resulting aim vector will be this vector with the quaternion rotation applied.

        Initial Up:
            The resulting up vector will be this vector with the quaternion rotation applied.

@Release_Notes Release Notes

    Version 0.0.2:
        - Support for arbitrary base aim/up vectors on extract
        - Known limitation of 0.0.1 is lifted (H12+)
        - Some UI cosmetics.

        WARNING:
            Non backwards-compatible parameter changes:
            - Parameter 'attr_N' renamed to 'attr_aim'

    Version 0.0.1:
        Initial release.

        KNOWN LIMITATION:
            When converting from Orient to Aim/Up, the resulting Aim vector will always be written
            as a per-point N (normal), too.
