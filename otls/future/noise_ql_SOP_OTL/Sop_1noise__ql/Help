*Version 0.1.0*

"""Modulates an attribute - possibly P - by a noise."""

TIP:
    The Noise qL SOP is implemented as a single VOP SOP, so you can map most of the parameters to attributes to further
    enhance the result. Most of the toggles form exceptions in this case as they are connected to the network by expressions
    instead of VOP parameters for performance reasons.

@Parameters
    Point Goup:
        Point group that gets affected by the deformer.
    Driver Attribute:
        Vector attribute that drives the noise generation.
    Driver Signature:
        Data type of the driver attribute.
    Target Attribute:
        Attribute that is modulated by the noise.
    Target Signature:
        Signature of the target attribute. Currently _float_ and _vector_ types are supported as the output.
    Mode:
        Target mode.
        * *Replace*: replaces the incoming value with the generated noise.
        * *Add*: adds the generated noise to the target attribute's incoming value.
        * *Multiply*: multiply the incoming value with the generated noise.
    Mask Attribute:
        Attribute that can _mask_ the modulation.
    Ivert:
        Inverts the effect of the mask attribute.
    Amount:
        Global multiplier of the modulation.
    Noise Parameters:
        If not otherwise indicated these are the exposed parameters of the underlying
        [Unified Noise VOP|Node:vop/unifiednoise]. See details there.
    Exponent:
        Sign-safe exponent applied after noise generation. It doesn't offset the result.
