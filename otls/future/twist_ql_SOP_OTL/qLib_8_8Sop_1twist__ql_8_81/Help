"""Twists and/or twirls geometry along axis."""

This is a replacement operator for the "twist" mode of the [Twist SOPNode:/twist].

The deformer rotates the points of the incoming geometry around the deformer's axis, which
can be trasformed with the transform parameters or an OBJ node's trasformation matrix. The amount of
rotation is interpolated between the start (top end) and the end (lower end) of the axis as well as between
the axis and the outer perimeter of the deformer.

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the deformer affects.
    Use Weight (Toggle):
        Use a weight attribute to mask the deformers operation.
    Weight Attrib:
        Name of the weight attribute.
    Invert Weight:
        Complements the weight attribute's effect.
    Start Angle (Outer/Inner):
        Outer and inner rotation amount in degrees on the start (top) end of the axis.
    End Angle (Outer/Inner):
        Outer and inner rotation amount in degrees on the end (lower) end of the axis.
    Bias/Gain:
        Bias and gain modifiers of the interpolation along the axis.
    Inner Bias/Gain:
        Bias and gain modifiers of the interpolation between the axis and outer perimeter of the
        deformer.
    Use Object Transform (Toggle):
        Use OBJ's transform matrix.
    Transform Object:
        OBJ operator to get the transformation matrix from.
    Transform Parameters:
        Standard transform parameters.
