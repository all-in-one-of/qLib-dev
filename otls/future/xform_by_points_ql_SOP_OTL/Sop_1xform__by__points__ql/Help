"""Transforms geometry groups, using point cloud points for individual placement (PrimGroup family SOP)."""

This SOP takes a geometry consisting of multiple geometry groups (pieces), and transforms each piece
using point cloud(s), wherein each point represents a centroid for a corresponding piece.

The input geometry should have an (usually per-primitive, called `__origpt`) attribute that specifies
an index number for each geometry element. This index is used to refer to a point with the same index
in the point cloud -- that point will be used for the transformation of the element.

TIP:
    A point cloud can be built using a [PrimGroup Centroids qL|Node:sop/primgroup_centroids_ql] SOP.
    Piece group indices can be generated using a [PrimGroup Add IDs qL|Node:sop/primgroup_add_ids_ql]
    node.

Two point clouds are expected: _rest_ and _transformation_. Transformation to each piece is applied
using the difference between the two. Rotations are implemented using an aim/up vector pair (can be
added to rest and transform both).

A single point cloud can also be used by using the same cloud for both inputs and storing `rest`
positions for its points.


@parameters
    Point Index Attribute:

        Index Attribute:
            Name of the (usually per-primitive) attribute that specifies which group the primitive
            belongs to.
            The default name is `__origpt` (to be in accord with the [Node:sop/voronoifracture] SOP).

        Convert to Per-Point Type:
            The index attribute needs to be of per-point type. If it is not, it has to be promoted
            temporarily.

        Original Class, Promotion Method:
            Settings on how to promote the attribute.
            

    Rest Point Attributes:

        Rest Position:
            Attribute that specifies the rest position (pivot) of each point cloud point
            (hence each geometry piece).

            Specify `rest` here when using a single point cloud.

        Rest Aim Vector, Rest Up Vector:
            Attributes that specify rest orientation for each point.
            Empty string means the appropriate default world axis direction.

    Transform Point Attributes:

        Position:
            Attribute that specifies the current position of each point cloud point
            (hence each geometry piece). Translation is calculated by the difference of
            this position and the rest position.

        Aim Vector, Up Vector:
            Attributes that specify the current orientation of each point.
            Empty string means the appropriate default world axis direction.

            Rotation is calculated from the difference of the rest and the transform
            aim and up vectors.

    NOTE:
            Scaling of individual pieces is not supported.
