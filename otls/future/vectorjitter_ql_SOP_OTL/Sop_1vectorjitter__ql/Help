This node can apply random length scaling of vector attributes, as well as random rotations
(within a specified angular range). It is useful whenever some irregularity of vector attributes
is desired.

One main application is randomizing lengths and angles of velocity vectors for particle-emitting
geometry, thereby controlling speed and yield of the emission.

This node works on per-point attributes.

@Parameters

    Point Group:
        The points to process.

    Vector Attributes:
        A list of attributes to jitter. Only per-point vector types are supported.

    Length Jitter:

        Length Jitter:
            Enable jittering of vector lengths.

        Pre-Normalize:
            Amount of length normalization of the vectors before the jittering is applied.

            NOTE:
                Velocity (`v`) is handled specially: its unit length
                equals to the `$FPS` value (as it's measured as per-second).

        Min Scale:
            Minimum scale value (or length multiplier) for length jitter.

        Max Scale:
            Maximum scale value (or length multiplier) for length jitter.

        Variance Exp.:
            An exponent (gamma) correction on the jitter values.



    Angle Jitter:

        Angle Jitter:
            Enable jittering of vector angles.

        Angle Min:
            Minimum amount of rotation in degrees.

        Angle Max:
            Maximum amount of rotation in degrees.

        Variance Exp.:
            An exponent (gamma) correction on the jitter values.

        Scale:
            Overall scale on the angular jitter effect. Zero means no rotation.

        PScale Attrib:
            The scale effect can be set on a per-point basis using an attribute.
            Specify a per-point float attribute here.

            Invert:
                Invert the per-point scale attribute.

            PScale Exponent:
                An exponent/gamma correction on the per-point scale attribute.
