*Version 0.0.1*

"""An alternative version of the regular Attrib Transfer SOP."""

This alternative implementation uses a VOPSOP/pointcloud functions, and works only for per-point
float and vector attributes.


Alternative Attrib Transfer SOP prototype:

- should be rewritten in full VEX
- due to current implementation, only transferring a single attribute is faster
- about 2x faster than the plain Attrib Transfer SOP (when transferring a single attribute)
