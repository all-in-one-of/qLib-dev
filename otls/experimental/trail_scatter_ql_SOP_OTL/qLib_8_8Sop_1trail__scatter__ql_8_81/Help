"""Scatters points on the motion trail of a geometry (for particle/fluid emission)."""

...

pros:
- calulates velocity vectors both for obj and sop level transformations;



cons/bugs:
- (FIXED) animated 'seed' value is not yet supported
- (FIXED) forwards/backwards get screwed up at substep 5, 10, (...)
    - 'fix': hackety-hack at world_space/emitter_source_worldspace/slice param
        - should be okay up to about 20 substeps ( blame floating point! :( )


TODO:
- jitter points along resulting velocity vectors
- make sure emitter velocity has the same magnitude, independent of any substep settings (i think its ok)
- velocity scale parameters should work in the negative range as well
