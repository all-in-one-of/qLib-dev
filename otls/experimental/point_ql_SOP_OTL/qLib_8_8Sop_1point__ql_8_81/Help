"""Convenience/shortcut operator to quickly add or set point attributes."""

The purpose of this node is to quickly set up some of the most frequently used
point attributes to constant initial values (e.g. to add initial normal/up pair aligned
with the world axes).

This node is similar to the [Node:sop/point] SOP, but with several key differences:
- Less attributes are available for setting
- The initial values can only be constants
- Initialization is much faster.
