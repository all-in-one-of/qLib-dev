= Default Geo qL =

"""The default geometry with some additional options."""

It can be useful for more reasons:

- The original 'defgeo.bgeo' file got accidentally overwritten (the asset contains the geometry itself)
- The asset provides options to quickly generate geometry with attributes on it, such as
    - Normals (per-point or per-vertex)
    - Colors (per-point, per-vertex or per-primitive)
- The X/Y/Z indicators can be made more visible with the various options (coloring or extruding them, etc.)
