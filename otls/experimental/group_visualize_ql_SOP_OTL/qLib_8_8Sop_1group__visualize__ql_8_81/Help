"""Visualization of geometry groups (points or primitives)."""

This operator applies color to geometry components, based on their group memberships.

TIP:
    This node is very useful as "visual checkpoint" when constructing complex effects involving
    more geometry groups. It's good practice to keep (maintain) visualizer node(s) at important points of
    the node tree.

For visualizing memberships, a _group mask_ is to be specified. Each group will be assigned an
own color from a color ramp, and group members will be colored accordingly.

Additionally, a _"hilite" mask_ can also be specified -- geometry that are members of a "hilited"
group will be applied a color with a different brightness (hilite intensity -- as opposed by
regular group color intensity). This functionality allows highlighting one (or few) particular
group(s).


@Parameters

    Input:
        Select which geometry input to visualize. Two (2) input slots are available.

        Workflow-wise this allows to connect a "before" and an "after" state, and quickly switch between
        them for comparison.

    Points / Primitives:

        This radio button group specifies the type of groups to be visualized (point or primitive).

        Group Mask:
            A list (or pattern) of groups to be visualized.

        Hilite Mask:
            An optional list of individual group(s) that should be visualized with a highlighted
            color intensity. (Usually a single group, but multiple elements can be used as well.)

        Display Points:
            Visualize points by turning them into particles (point groups only).

        Keep Points Only:
            Delete all geometry component types except points (point groups only).


    Group Colors:
        ...

        Intensity (Regular, Hilite):
            Color intensity (brightness) for both the regular and the highlighted geometry
            pieces.

            If no _hilite_ group(s) given, the _hilite_ brightness is used for all geometry.

        Group Colors (Ramp):
            A ramp to pick colors from for each individual group.

        Lookup Offset, Frequency:
            These parameters affect which color from the ramp will be mapped to each
            geometry group.

            TIP:
                If a frequency of `0` is given, all groups will get the same color from the ramp
                (which can be changed using the _offset_ parameter). This can be useful if you
                want to use _hilite_-ing but without visual flamboyance.

        Display Gamma:
            Setting of the gamma-correction applied to all group colors.

        Default Color:
            Color of geometry components with no or irrelevant membership.

@Release_Notes Release Notes

_interface version 1_ ---

2012-11-09:
    First version.

    NOTE:
        The implementation could be slow on large amounts of geometry.
        (Once the exact functionality details are agreed upon, some internals
        could be replaced with python code -- especially the primitive processing parts.)
