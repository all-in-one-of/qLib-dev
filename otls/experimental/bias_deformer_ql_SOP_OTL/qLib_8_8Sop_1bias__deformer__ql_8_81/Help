"""Deforms geometry by applying bias/gain value adjustments along the main axes."""

This node applies a deformation that can "stretch" the geometry along all main axes.
The stretching is applied using a bias/gain curve along each axis.

Use the deformer placement to set the location and orientation of the effect.

@parameters
    Deformer parameters:

        Order:
            Calculation order (either _Bias/Gain_ or _Gain/Bias_).
        Bias:
            Bias values for each main axis.
        Gain:
            Gain values for each main axis.

    Deformer template parameters:
        All parameters common to deformer-type nodes.

        Point Group:
            The points the deformer will be applied to.
            Empty means the entire geometry.

        Envelope:
            Deformer envelope.

        Weight:
            Deformer weight attribute (should be a per-point float attribute).

            Name:
                Name of the weight attribute.
            Invert:
                Use the inverse of weight attribute values.

        Transform:
            These parameters specify the location of the deformer's effect in 3d space.

            Use Object Transform:
                Bind the deformer's placement to the location of an `OBJ` object.
            Object Name:
                Path of the `OBJ` object to be used for placement.
            Rest/Parent Object:
                If enabled, the placement object's relative transformation to this object will be used
                (instead of plain world space).
            Transform:
                (To do) (None/Into this Object/Into Specified Object)
            Transform Object:
                (to do)
            (regular transformation parameters):
                Use these parameters to set deformer placement if _Use Object Transform_ is off.
