*interface version 1*

"""A an alternative for the Advect by Volumes POP that uses point clouds."""

This is the same operator as the [Node:pop/advectbyvolumes] POP node, but instead of volumes,
it uses a vector attribute from a SOP point cloud to advect particles.

Otherwise it's exactly identical to the aforementioned POP.


@parameters
    See the [Node:pop/advectbyvolumes] documentation for parameter descriptions not mentioned here.

    Velocity Geometry:
        Path to a SOP geometry with a per-point vector attribute to be used for advection.

    Velocity Attribute:
        Name of a vector attribute on the point cloud to use for advection.

    Lookup radius:
        No points further than this distance will affect the particle.

    Number of Points:
        The maximum number of points to consider from the point cloud when advecting the particle.

    NOTE:
        Pointcloud-based advection (and point cloud-lookup in general) works by considering neighbouring
        points in the pointcloud, and calculating their average.

        The lookup starts from the 3d position of the point to be advected, and the pointcloud points are
        considered, sorted by distance. The lookup is completed _either_ the lookup radius is reached _or_
        the number of lookup points are reached. (e.g. for dense point clouds, if the max number of points
        are low, the actual lookup radius will always be low, regardless of the radius setting.)
