*interface version 1*

"""A more convenient alternative for the original Source POP."""

This operator is a wrapper around the original Source POP, providing the following additional/alternative features:

- Birth rates have multiplier values (for easier gradual emission adjustment)
- A global birth rate multiplier is also provided (to reduce overall particle count, for faster previews, etc.)
- Useful presets for activations and birth rates
- Lifespan variance is specified using min/max values

@Parameters
    See the [Source POP|Node:pop/source] documentation for details.

TIP:
    The _Global Rate Multiplier_ can be used to reduce emission amounts for all sources in a POP network (to provide
    faster interaction, for example). To achieve this, create the same parameter on the popnet container, then link
    all `Source qL` global multipliers to this parameter.
