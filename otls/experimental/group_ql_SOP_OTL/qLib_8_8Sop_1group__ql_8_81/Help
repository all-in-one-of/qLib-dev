*version 1*

"""Group creation and editing using a series of operations."""

This operator provides an alternative to the original [Group SOP|Node:sop/group]. It provides the exact same
(sometimes a bit enhanced) functionality, but instead of having a fixed order, operations can be freely
arranged.


@Parameters
    Operations:
        A series of group-related operations. Make sure to read the [Group SOP documentation|Node:sop/group].

        Create:
            Create a new group based on various criteria.

        Combine:
            Combine existing groups using boolean (set) operations.

        Rename:
            Rename group(s).

            Note that renaming multiple groups are supported (as per the regular Group SOP):
            to do this, use an asterisk (*) in both old and new name fields.

        Convert:
            Convert group(s) to one type to another. There are the following differences
            to the original Group SOP function:
            - Conversion of multiple groups _is_ supported (alas, group patterns not yet allowed)
            - Renaming (hence Preserve Original) is _not_ supported

        Delete:
            Delete the specified group(s). A pattern specifying multiple groups is accepted.

TODO:
    - convert should really convert multiple groups with wildcards and everything
    - bounding object primitive group support (ie. use not the entire object but a specified sub-group)
    - correct disable behaviour of convert/omit
