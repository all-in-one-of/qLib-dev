"""Rotates geometry from one main plane to another."""

The rotation is built using two inputs: _input orientation_ specifies which main plane the rotation
starts from (e.g. XY, YZ, ZX), and the rotation will be so that this plane will assume its new
orientation specified by the _orientation_ parameter.

NOTE:
    This node is a helper or "component" for building higer level operators. (For example, it is used in all
    qLib deformer nodes to provide an unified interface for deformation placement.)

@parameters

    Input Orientation:
        The original main plane orientation of the model.

        XY, YZ, ZX:
            Consider this main plane as the starting point of the rotation.

    Orientation:
        The desired orientation of the model.

        XY, YZ, ZX:
            The plane specified in *Input Orientation* will be rotated to match this plane.

    Invert:
        Perform invert (opposite) transformation.
