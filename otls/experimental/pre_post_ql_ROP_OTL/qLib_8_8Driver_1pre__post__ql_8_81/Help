"""Fixed version of the original pre-post node."""

A (hopefully temporary) replacement for the regular Pre/Post ROP (with more restricted functionality).

NOTE:

This asset addresses a bug in the regular Pre/Post ROP: if the main job has upstream job(s), they will
be executed _before_ the pre-render job, which kinda defeats the purpose. :(



- Supports only sequence rendering

- Setting frame ranges:
    - The frame range has to be set on the asset
    - All inputs (pre/main/post) are best to be set to 'Render Any Frame'

- Rendering
    - The pre-render will be called at the first frame of the range
    - The main job will be run as expected
    - The post-render job will be called at the last frame of the range

The main job can have upstream jobs -- everything will always be processed in a 'Node by Node' fashion
(ie. non-interleaved, one upstream node finishes its range completely, only after that will be the next
node processed).
