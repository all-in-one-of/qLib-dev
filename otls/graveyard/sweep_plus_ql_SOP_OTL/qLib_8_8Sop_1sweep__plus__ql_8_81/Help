*version 1*

"""Creates a surface by sweeping cross-sections along a backbone curve with ramp parameters controling scale and twist."""

This node is a replacement of the original [Sweep SOP|Node:sop/sweep], providing 

@Parameters
    Sweep:
        See the [Node:sop/sweep] documentation for parameters.
        Additional parameters are described below.

        WARNING:
            Do *not* enable _Remove Coincident Points on Path_ if you have an animated path (backbone) spline,
            as it can cause frame-to-frame topology changes (and a lot of grief when dealing with motion blur
            and/or exporing to other applications, expecting consistent topology).

            This node has this parameter _off_ by default.

        Reverse Cross Section(s), Reverse Backbone:
            Reverse the direction of the profile and/or path curve(s).

            (e.g.: if the surface normals of the resulting geometry point inwards, reverse cross-section curve direction.)

        Scale:
            Scale Multiplier:
                Global scale multiplier for profile scale.
        
            Profile Scale:
                Modulates the profile along the backbone, default is 1.

        Twist:        
            Twist Multiplier:
                Multiplyer of the _Profile Twist_ parameter in degrees.
        
            Profile Twist:
                Modulates the twist parameter along the backbone, default is 0 (no twist).

    Output:
        Add Texture UVs:
            A quick convenience switch to generate basic UV coordinates for the resulting surface.

            NOTE:
                It is geared towards working with parametric-type geometry, so make sure all inputs
                are of that type (NURBS curves, etc.)

                Also, make sure the _Cycle Type_ parameter is set to a mode that supports UV generation
                (marked with `*` in the UI).

        Cross Section(s), Backbone:
            Parametrization setting for UV coordinates generation for the cross section and backbone curves.
            (See the [UV Texture SOP|Node:sop/texture] for description.)

TIP:
    To have proper UV texturing coordinates, do the following:
    - Assign UVs to the backbone spline using an [Node:sop/texture], SOP (using one of its _Spline_ modes)
    - Assign UVs to the cross section curve(s) the same way, but rotate the UVs by `-90` degrees.
    - Set _Cycle Type_ to "One Primitive at a Time" (or "Cycle Primitives").
