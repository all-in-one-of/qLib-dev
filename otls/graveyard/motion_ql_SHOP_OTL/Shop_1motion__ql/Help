*Version 0.1.0*

"""Motion vector shader."""

WARNING:
    This asset is obsolete and not maintained any further. Please use [Node:shop/motion_vectors_ql] instead.

This is a convenience shader based on the Motion qL VOP. It exports the motion vectors to the color channel (Cf).
If you need to export the motion vectors to another image plane you can use the VOP equivalent.

TIP:
    To render a motion pass:
        # set the desired shutter speed on the camera
        # turn on the *Allow Motion Blur* toggle on the ROP
        # add (if it's not already there) and turn off the *Allow Image Motion Blur* toggle on the ROP
        # Set pixel filter to either *minmax ocover* (Object With Most Pixel Coverage) or *minmax min* (closet sample filtering)

@Parameters
    Mode:
        Motion qL supports three modes:
            * 2D (pixel): movements in image space in pixels.
            * 2D (NDC): movements in image space in normalized device coordinates.
            * 3D: movements in 3D.
