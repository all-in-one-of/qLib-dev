= Merge Pieces qL =

WARNING:
    This asset is obsolete and will be removed from the next release. Use use group patterns like 'piece*' in
    [Node:dop/rbdfracturedobject]'s Group Mask parameter to import more than one fractured object into one
    simulation. 

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Merges two geometry branches while keeping piece groups by renumbering them."""

@Parameters
    Group Name Prefix:
        The prefix of the group names of pieces to keep.

    TIP:
        Don't use '*' after the prefix. While some other tools needs that Merge Pieces don't.

    New Start:
        Renamed group numbers will start here.

    TIP:
        The default values for the detail attributes will work in most cases, for example when the pieces
        are generated by a voronoi fracture node. Adjus them only if you want to achieve some spetial renumbering.
        
    Original Range:
        The range (start, stop, step) of the origianl groups that will be renamed.

@Limitations
    Automatic range detection expects that the original base group numbering starts at 0. If this is not the case
    you have to manually tweak the attributes in the detail folder to adjust to the situation.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
