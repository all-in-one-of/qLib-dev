*Version 0.2.1*

"""Creates separate primitive for each poly curve segment."""

WARNING:
    This asset is obsolete. Use [Node:sop/polywirecurves_ql] instead.

@Limitations
    Works correctly with single polygonal curves only.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.2.1:
        Creates open curve segments, instead of closed ones. Creates curve segment for closing segment if original
        is closed.

    Version 0.2.0:
        A faster and cleaner rewrite of the original functionality.

        NOTE:
            While the primitive order is the same, the output is not identical, since this version
            does not introduce new points in the geometry, only the primitives. (But this is how it should work :)

    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
