*Version 0.1.1*

"""Deforms geometry by turbulent noise."""

WARNING:
    This asset is obsolete and will be removed from the next release. Use the [Noise SOP|Node:sop/noise_ql] instead.

@Parameters
    Point Goup:
        Point group that gets affected by the deformer.
    Along Normal:
        Points get displaced along the normal vector. The Y axis belongs to the normal direction.
    Stricktly Along Normal:
        Only displaces along the normal.
    Absolute Y:
        Displaces with the absolute value of the Y axis noise.
    Noise Type:
        Type of the generated turbulent noise. See the documentation of the Turbulent Noise VOP for details.
    Amount:
        Global amount of the deformation.
    Axis Amount:
        Amount for the different axises.
    Roughness:
        See the documentation of the Turbulent Noise VOP for details.
    Attenuation:
        See the documentation of the Turbulent Noise VOP for details.
    Turbulance:
        See the documentation of the Turbulent Noise VOP for details.
    Transform:
        Standard transform parameters. Translate corresponds to the noise's offset, while scale to the frequency.
    Clamp:
        Clamps the generated values.
