"""Various visualization types for geometry attributes."""


@Parameters
    Preprocessing:

        Decimation & Safeguards:

            Ways of reducing the amount of geometry to visualize.

            Keep Every Nth:
                Keep only a single item for each N points or primitives.
    
            Prim. # Limit:
                Keep only the specified amount of primitives before doing any visualization.
                This is a safeguard measure to avoid accidents like hanging on a very
                large geometry.

                *This function is intentionally enabled by default.*

        Attribute Promotion:
            Parameters in this tab allows visualizing other attribute types than per-point,
            by modifying the geometry itself and/or convert attribute(s) to per-point type.

            Unique Points:
                This splits all shared geometry points, so there will be the same number of
                points as vertices -- allowing per-vertex attributes to be visualized as
                per-point.
    
            Primitive Scale:
                Applied to all primitives after the Unique Points operation. Especially with
                previously shared points, this can make individual points visually more
                distinct.
    
            Promote Attribute(s) to Per-Point:
                After the preprocessing above, all other attribute types (ie. per-vertex,
                per-primitive, etc.) can safely be converted to per-point type for
                visualization. A list of multiple attribute names is supported.

    Floats:
        Visualization of floating-point values by mapping the values to a color ramp
        and apply the colors to the geometry accordingly.

        NOTE:
            Other visualizations inherit these colors.

        Attribute Name, Type, Component:
            Name of the attribute to visualize (a single attribute name only), as well as
            the attribute type (integer, float, vector) and component (X, Y, Z or length).

        Value Range:
            The value range the color ramp will be mapped to.

        Attribute Color Ramp:
            The ramp representing the range of values.

        Display Gamma:
            Color-correction for non-linear viewport settings. Set this gamma value to
            the same you set up in your viewport (`2.2` for sRGB).

    Vectors:
        Vector visualization (drawn as line segments from geometry points).

        Attribute Name:
            Name of the attribute(s) to visualize (multiple attributes can be specified).

        Scale:
            An uniform scaling factor on the vectors display.

        Unit Length:
            The equivalent of unit type. This is relevant only with velocity-type vectors
            where the unit is distance-per-second. (If visualizing velocity, select "`Velocity`"
            from the preset menu.)

            Note that this applies to all vectors being visualized.

    Orient & Scale:
        Orient/scale-type visualization (implemented using a Copy SOP). A geometric object is
        copied to each point of the input geometry.
        - The size of each copy will be affected by the `pscale` attribute;
        - Orientation will be affected by existing orientation (`orient`), velocity (`v`),
            normal (`N`) and up vector (`up`) attributes.

    Output:
        Settings on how to output visualization results.
