"""Assigns attribute values defined by the shape of an object, or an SDF volume."""

This nodes generates per-point attribute values for a geometry, using the shape of a secondary geometry
as mask.


@Parameters
    Point Group:
        Points that get affected.

    Shape:
        Type of the boundary shape. The "object" or "volume" should be connected to the second input.

    Attribute, Local Variable:
        Name, type (signature) and local variable name of the attribute where the values get stored.

        If the local variable field is left blank, the name will be the upper-case version of
        the attribute name.

    Inner Value, Outer Value:
        Value inside/outside the shape.

    Falloff Distance:
        Falloff distance measured from the surface.
        
        TIP:
            Multiply Falloff Distance with Scale value to get constant penumbra for varying size boundary object.

    Exponent:
        Exponent of the falloff.

    Invert:
        Switch inner and outer values.

    Mode:
        How the newly created values get composed to the existing values.

    Source Attribute:
        Name of the source attribute used in compositing operations.

    Transform:
        Standard transform parametres determines the size and position of the shape.

    Volume Resolution:
        Resolution of the generated volume.

        NOTE:
            For performance and quality reasons the transform is applied after the volume generation thus a scaling
            "inside" the operator won't increase the resolution of the volume.

    Laser Scan:
        Turn it off for objects with inner structures.

    Show Geometry Guide, Show Weights:
        Display the secondary geometry as a wireframe guide, and/or visualize the generated weight map
        on the geometry points (using a heat map).

        NOTE:
            Only the weight map of the current shape is displayed. If multiple shapes are composited together,
            use an [Attr Visualize qL SOP|Node:sop/qLib::attr_visualize_ql::1] at the end of the chain to
            inspect the results.


@Limitations
    When the input attribute is not present in the geometry only the 'Replace' mode works correctly. This is due to
    performance considerations, probably won't change in the future.

@Release_Notes Release Notes

    Version 0.2.1:
        - Minor internal cleanups and UI enhancements
        - Visualization of current shape weight results
        - Toggles for guide displays

    Version 0.2.0:
        Almost complete overhaul of the inner workings. Now the operator uses SDF volumes instead of distance measures,
        which results in much more flexibility and probably slower cooking.

    Version 0.1.2:
        Fixed a bug which resulted an unneeded float attrib even when the signature was vector.

        Inner and outer value parameters are color+alpha now.

    Version 0.1.1:
        Added local variable support.

    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
