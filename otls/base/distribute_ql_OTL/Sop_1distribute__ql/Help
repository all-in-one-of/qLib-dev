"""Distribute points in space so, that a pscale radius sphere around them doesn't intersect."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        Points to distribute.
    Calculate Radius:
        Calculate uniform radius based on the primitive area of the geometry connected to the second input
        and the number of points.
    Radius Factor:
        Multiplies the result of the radius calculation.
    Radius:
        The radius of the points if the 'pscale' attribute is not present.
    Iterations:
        Number of iterations.
        
        TIP:
            Increase this gradually until you reach the desired result. Note that increasing the radius can also
            result in better distibution without a speed penalty.
    Max Neighbours:
        The maximum numbers of points that acount for the new position of a point in an iteration.
    Grow:
        Gradually increase the radius of points during distribution. This may help points to get to places which
        otherwise would be unreachable for them.
    Ray:
        Project points back to the geometry connected to the second input.
    Ray Every Nth:
        Only project every Nth iteration and the last one.
    Ray Intersection Normal:
        Points inherit the geometry normals of the ray surface.
    Ray Group:
        Group of points to project.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.3:
        Point Group added. Caculate Radius added. Ray Every Nth added.
    Version 0.1.2:
        Ray Goup parameter added. Linked back Ray Intersection Normal.
    Version 0.1.1:
        Exposed the Point Intersection Normal parameter of the Ray SOP. It's label is Ray Intersection Normal for
        clarity.
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release. While it's really not ready, it's usable.
