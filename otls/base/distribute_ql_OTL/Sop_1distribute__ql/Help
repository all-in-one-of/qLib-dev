*Version 0.1.1*

"""Tries to distributes points in space so, that a pscale radius sphere around them doesn't intersect."""

@Parameters
    Radius:
        The radius of the points if the 'pscale' attribute is not defined on them.
    Iterations:
        Number of iterations.
        
        TIP:
            As good the start condition is as few iterations are needed to achieve a good state.
    Max Neighbours:
        The maximum numbers of points that acount for the new position of a point in an iteration.
    Grow:
        Gradually increase the radius of points. This may help points to get to places which otherwise would
        be unreachable for them.
    Ray:
        Project points back to the geometry connected to the second input.
    Ray Intersection Normal:
        When both Ray and this flag is active, points inherit the geometry normals of the underlying surface.

@Limitations
    Grouping doesn't work.

    Ray frequency not implemented.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.1:
        Exposed the Point Intersection Normal parameter of the Ray SOP. It's label is Ray Intersection Normal for
        clarity.
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release. While it's really not ready, it's usable.
