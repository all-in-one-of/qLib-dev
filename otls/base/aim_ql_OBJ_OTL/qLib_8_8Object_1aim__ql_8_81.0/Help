*Version 0.0.1*

"""A simple aim/look-at transformation node, with up-vector object support."""

This object type implements similar functionality like the 'Look At' parameter on
objects nodes, but providing up vector controls.

The aim is computer the same way as expected: the resulting transformation will
look at the aim with its _negative Z axis_. The up vector will be matched with
the _positive Y axis_ as much as possible (but the aim direction always takes
preference).


NOTE: (for beginners)
    Aim (or 'look-at') transformation is one of the most fundamental things which
    has relevance everywhere from camera controls to character rigs. So it is
    worthwhile to grasp and keep in mind that _a plane is defined by_ *three* _points
    in space_.


@inputs Inputs
    1. Position Object:
        The world space position of the connected object will be the center point
        (or origin) of the resulting aim transform. Rotations on this input are ignored.

    2. Aim Object:
        The object to look at. The resulting transform will have its _negative Z_ axis
        aimed at this object.

    3. Up Object (Optional):
        If connected, the resulting transformation's _positive Y axis_ will be aimed
        at this object as much as it is allowed by the main aim direction vector.

        If no object is connected here, the up direction is determined by the 
        `Up Vector` parameter.


@Parameters
    Up Vector:
        The direction of the up vector. Only used if no `Up Object` is connected (3rd input).

    Show Vectors:
        Draw lines from the center to both the aim and up points (or directions).

    Show Transform:
        Display a null object variant to represent the aim transformation.
