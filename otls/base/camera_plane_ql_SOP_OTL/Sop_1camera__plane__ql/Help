*Version 0.0.3*

"""Builds a properly-fitted view plane for a given camera at the specified distance."""

This SOP creates a grid that exactly represents the camera viewing plane at a given distance.

The geometry will be aligned to the viewing plane of the camera, and resized according to
the various camera viewing settings (aspect ratio, focal/aperture, screen window and cropping).


== Attributes ==

The resulting plane has several attributes that can be helpful later:

rest:
    contains the positions of the base grid, the full uncropped grid one unit distance from the camera.
    This is always in camera space.

uv:
    the UV coordinates of the plane, cropped properly if a crop is applied.

N:
    points away from the camera, so it can be used to project the geometry to some other geometry while maintaining
    the screen filling properties of the grid.

@Parameters
    Camera:
        The camera that the plane belongs to.

    Space:
        The coordinate space the plane is generated into.

        Object Space:
            The plane will assume the transformations of the camera, ending up the expected object (world) space
            position.

        Camera Space:
            The plane will be generated in camera local space (it will _not_ contain any transformations from the
            camera).

            NOTE:
                The simplest way of getting the plane in place is to parent its geometry container object
                to the camera.

    Plane Distance:
        The distance of the plane from the camera.

    Overscan X/Y:
        Scale factor in screen space.

    Cropping:
        Use Camera Crop:
            Use the corresponding camera's crop settings to crop the plane.
    
        Crop Left/Right/Bottom/Top:
            Crop settings if 'Use Camera Crop' not active.

    Geometry:
        See the [Grid SOP documentation|Node:sop/grid] for parameter descriptions.

    Shading:
        Export UV:
            Generate UV coordinates.
    
        Apply Material:
            Applies a basic constant material.
    
        Texture:
            Name of the texture file.
