= Fetch SOP qL =

*version 1*

"""A POP node to fetch points of a SOP geometry as particles."""

This node fetches the specified SOP geometry into the POP network so the geometry points will become
particles. It also fetches/updates all relevant geometry attributes for each frame (evaluation),
so the up-to-date values of these attributes will always be present on the resulting particles.

@parameters
    Birth:
        SOP:
            Path to the SOP geometry to fetch.

        Settings:
            ...

        Attributes:
            ...

    Update:
        The list of attributes to keep up-to-date. If the attribute's _Update_ field is non-zero,
        its current value will be retrieved from the SOP network on each POP evaluation.

        In other words, the same color/normal/etc. attributes will always be present in the POP
        network as well, with the same values as in the SOP network.
