= Maze qL =

"""Builds a maze from polylines on the horizontal plane."""

This is a very simple and fun 'primitive'. It generates the maze with 'recursive division method'.
The created maze has no closed areas: a way can always be found between two places within
the maze.

NOTE:
    The node doesn't provide entry/exit openings (on the outer walls), cutting them is left for
    the user to do. (As of the property mentioned above, the entry/exit can be placed anywhere
    on the outer walls, with no restrictions.)

@Parameters

Lower Left Corner:
    Lower left corner of the maze.
Upper Right Corner:
    Yeah, just that.
Seed:
    Seed of the random function that divides the space.
Limit Divisions:
    Limit the number of the division steps.
Limit:
    Number of divisions when _Limit Divisions_ toggled.
Outer Walls:
    Draw outer walls.
