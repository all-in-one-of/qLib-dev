*Version 0.1.2*

"""Performs common operations between per-point vector attributes on the input geometry."""

The most common vector-related operations encapsulated in one node. One of the most frequently used operators.


NOTE:
    Although this node might seem a bit monolithic in nature, it encapsulates the most frequently
    required vector-related operations (and it does that within a single VOP SOP, so it is _fast_).


@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points affected.

    Operation:
        The main vector operation to be performed.
        The following operations are available:
        * Add
        * Substract (A-B)
        * Substract (B-A)
        * Mix
        * Cross Product (AxB)
        * Cross Product (BxA)
        * Pass 1st Input (A)
        * Pass 2nd Input (B)

    Input:

        Vector A/B:

            The two tabs represent separate settings for each of the two sets of vectors.
            All these settings are applied to the vectors (in order) before the main operation.

            Pre-Compute Normal:
                Precompute normals for the input geometry.
    
            Vector:
                Type of vector (geometry attribute or constant).
    
            Attribute Name:
                The name of the vector attribute. (If the second input is not connected
                the attribute is read from the first input.)
    
            Constant:
                Vector value for the Constant type.
    
            Normalize:
                Normalize vector value. (Applies to the constant value as well.)

            Scale with:
                Scale the vector with the specified (float) attribute.


        Mix Settings:

            These settings are used in `Mix` mode only.
    
            Blend Value:
                A constant mixing value.

            Blend Attribute:
                A per-point float attribute to use as mix value.

    Output:
        Normalize Output:
            Normalize the output vector.

        Scale:
            Scale factor for the output vector.

            TIP:
                When generating velocity vectors, use `$FPS` as scale factor.
                (Velocity vectors work on a per-second basis.)

        Invert Result:
            Negate the output vector (so it will point to the opposite direction).

        Output Attributes:

            Names and toggles of various attributes to output.

            Vector:
                The target attribute of the vector operation result.
    
            Length:
                The length of the result vector.
                (This vector is _not_ normalized--the Scale factor applies, though.)
    
            Dot Product:
                Dot product of the two input vectors.
    
            Angle:
                Angle between the two input vectors.
    
            Angle In Degrees:
                Output angle in degrees instead of radians.
