*Version 0.1.1*

"""Bends geometry along a circular arc."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the deformer affects.
    Amount:
        Amount of deformation in degrees.
        
        NOTE:
            Due to floating point precision problems amounts less than 0.01 degrees results in no deformation.
    Low Bound:
        Limits the deformation in the lower end of the deformer. This allows one to create assimetric deformations.
    High Bound:
        Limits the deformation in the higher end of the deformer.
    Transform:
        Standard xform parameters that defines the position of the deformer.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.1:
        Fixed a bug which caused wrong quide geometry, when the deformer was rotated.
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release. This replaces end *enhances* the old qBend deformer.

        Eliminated a bug which resulted in erroneous behavior when extremely low amounts of deformation was made.

        Guide geometry is now properly handled and it's never included in the output of the operator.
