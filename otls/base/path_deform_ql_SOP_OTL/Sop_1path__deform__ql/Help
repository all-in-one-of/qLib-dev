*Version 0.3.1*

"""Slides and deforms geometry along a curve."""

@Inputs
    Geometry To Deform:
        The geometry that gets deformed along the path.
    Path Curve:
        The deformation path.
    Up Path:
        Optional curve that defines the up vector for the path curve.

@Parameters
    Position:
        The position of the deformed geometry along the path.
    Resize By Segment Length:
        Resize the deformed geometry to be proportional to the deformer curve's length.
    Segment Length:
        The relative length of the deformed geometry over the path if _Resize By Segment Length_ is on.
    Divisions:
        Lattice divisions. Higher values results in more precise curve following.
    Resolution:
        Whatever type of curve is connected to the inputs it gets converted to an evenly spaced polygonal curve.
        This parameter defines the resolution of the resulting curve. Increase it proportionally with the length of your
        path curve.
    Up Vector:
        If no Up Path is connected this vector defines the Up direction.
    Interpolation:
        Interpolation type of the underlying lattice.

        NOTE:
            Due to a limitation of the Lattice SOP, `Bezier` mode only supports up to
	    30 divisions (use `Linear` mode for higher resolutions).


@Release_Notes Release Notes
    Version 0.3.1:
        Added input path curve as guide geometry (displaying the resampled resolution).
    Version 0.3.0:
        Now the Z axis is deformed along the curve. _Resize By Segment Length_ is an option, and the deformed geometry can
        keep its size. Support of zero length side geometry like grids, etc.
    Version 0.2.1:
        Lattice intepolation type parameter exposed to the user.
    Version 0.2.0:
        New lattice placement method takes the initial position of the geometry into account. This means that
        geometries not centered around the origin will give different results. Also added some guide geometry.
    Version 0.1.1:
        Deleted some garbage.
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
