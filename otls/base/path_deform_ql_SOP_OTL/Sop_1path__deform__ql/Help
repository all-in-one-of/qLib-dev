= Path Deform qL =

*Version 0.2.1*

"""Slides and deforms geometry along a curve."""

@Inputs
    Geometry To Deform:
        The geometry that gets deformed along the path.
    Path Curve:
        The deformation path.
    Up Path:
        Optional curve that defines the up vector for the path curve.

@Parameters
    Position:
        The position of the deformed geometry along the path.
    Segment Length:
        The relative length of the deformed geometry over the path.
    Divisions:
        Lattice divisions. Higher values results in more precise curve following.
    Resolution:
        Whatever type of curve is connected to the inputs it gets converted to an evenly spaced polygonal curve.
        This parameter defines the resolution of the resulting curve. Increase it proportionally with the length of your
        path curve.
    Up Vector:
        If no Up Path is connected this vector defines the Up direction.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.2.1:
        Lattice intepolation type parameter exposed to the user.
    Version 0.2.0:
        New lattice placement method takes the initial position of the geometry into account. This means that
        geometries not centered around the origin will give different results. Also added some guide geometry.
    Version 0.1.1:
        Deleted some garbage.
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
