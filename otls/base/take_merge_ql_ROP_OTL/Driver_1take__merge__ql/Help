= Take Merge qL =

"""Merges specified takes together into a (temporary) new take, then renders the result."""

The takeMerge ROP merges all the specified takes together, then calls the specified
output driver.

It allows you to work around the hierarchical nature of takes: they will behave
more like 'tags' or 'labels' (or 'overrides' in other applications).

Examples of...

...what can be stored in takes:
    * render layer settings (object flags) (say _character_, _background_)
    * settings for single-frame mplay or output image sequence (say _singleframe_, _sequence_)
    * render quality settings (say _draft_, _production_)

...how do you combine (merge) them:
    * '_draft_ _singleframe_' to get a quick render of the scene
    * '_production_ _character_ _singleframe_' to get a production-quality single frame render of the character
    * '_draft_ _background_ _sequence_' to get a rough-quality image sequence of the background layer

With regular hierarchical takes all of the above is much harder to achieve.



@parameters

Merged Take Name:
    The name of the new take (the merge result) that will be rendered.

    The default settings is to inherit the name of the node,
    as it is recommended to _give each takeMerge node the name of the render layer it represents_.

    This take is temporary: it exists only during render and gets deleted on completion.

    WARNING: The name of this take must be unique: no take should exist with the same name.


Output Driver:
    The name of the ROP node that is called after the merged take is activated.

    WARNING: The Output Driver ROP node must be set to render the '(Current)' take.
    Also, the Output Driver *must be specified with an absolute path*.


Takes:
    The list of take names to be merged.
    Each text field can contain multiple take names (this allows for
    more flexible editing.)

    Non-existing take names are silently ignored.


Test--Create/Update Merged Take (button):
    This convenience button allows you to manually check the results of
    the take merge: it creates the merged take but will not render it.

    The other button deletes the temporary take (you have to switch back
    to the Main take manually first).

TIP:
    If you want to use a single Output Driver:
    * specify `$ACTIVETAKE.$F4.exr` (or similar) as output file name in your ROP node
    * for each takeMerge node that represents a render layer, name it after the layer it represents

    This way you can run all your layers through a single ROP node, and all resulting
    image sequences will be named appropriately.

TIP:
    One reason why there are multiple 'Takes' text fields is to allow editing of single
    lines _when multiple nodes are selected_ without changing the other fields.

    This fact you can work with to your advantage (using specific fields for specific
    types of overrides ... I mean takes).
