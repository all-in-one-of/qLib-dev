"""Applies an image file as a textured shader to a surface (an enhanced version of [Node:sop/uvquickshade])."""

This is a convenience operator that lets you very quickly put an image file on a surface.

@Features
    Use Lighting:
        Lighting can be disabled on the model, allowing easier inspecting of the UV texture projection.

    Bump mapping (viewport-only):
        The texture image can also be applied as a bump map.

    Environment mapping (viewport-only):
        An environment map can also be applied. This is useful to determine if curved surfaces have
        the appropriate shape for aesthetic reflections, for example.

Please note that this SOP _does not generate_ UV mapping coordinates.

    TODO: Finish this help.
