= Bend qL =

*interface version 1*

"""Bends geometry along a circular arc."""

A replacement operator for the "bend" mode of the [Twist SOP|Node:sop/twist].

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the deformer affects.

    Amount:
        Amount of deformation in degrees.
        
        NOTE:
            Due to floating point precision issues, less than 0.01 degrees results in no deformation.
            (This is intentional, in order to avoid deformation artifacts.)

    Low Bound:
        Limits the deformation in the lower end of the deformer. This allows one to create asymmetric deformations.

    High Bound:
        Limits the deformation in the higher end of the deformer.

    Transform:
        Standard xform parameters that defines the position of the deformer.

@relnotes Release Notes

_interface version 1_ ---

...


_older versions_ ---

Version 0.1.1:
    Fixed a bug which caused wrong quide geometry, when the deformer was rotated.

Version 0.1.0:
    - Initial release. (This replaces end *enhances* the old qBend deformer.)
    - Eliminated a bug which resulted in erroneous behavior when extremely low amounts of deformation was made.
    - Guide geometry is now properly handled and it's never included in the output of the operator.
