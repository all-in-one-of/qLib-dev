= Weighted Transform qL =

*Interface Version 1*

"""Transforms points weighted by an attribute on the geometry."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        Points that get affected.
    Weight Attribute:
        Name of the point attribute that masks the transforms.
    Invert:
        Inverts the effect of the weight attribute.
    Envelope:
        Global effect envelope.
    Use Object (Toggle):
        Fetch transformation matrix from an object node.
    Object Name:
        Name of the object to fetch the transformation matrix from.
    Transform Parameters:
        Standard transform parameters.        

@Limitations
    Currently the operator does a simple linear interpolation between the original and the transformed points. This is fast
    but the results are poor when heavy rotations needed.
