= Weighted Transform qL =

*Interface Version 1*

"""Transforms points weighted by an attribute on the geometry."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        Points that get affected.
    Weight Attribute:
        Name of the point attribute that masks the transforms.
    Invert:
        Inverts the effect of the weight attribute.
    Envelope:
        Global effect envelope.
    Use Object Transform(Toggle):
        Fetch transformation matrix from an object node.
    Base Object:
        The deformer transformation will be the _difference_ of this object's transformation and the
        *Deformer Object*'s.
    Deformer Object:
        The deformer transformation will be the _difference_ of the *Base Object*'s transformation and
        this object's.
    Mind Container Transform:
        Take the geometry container's transformation into account when calculating the _difference_ of
        the base and deformer objects' transformations.
    Transform Parameters:
        Standard transform parameters.
    Invert Transform:
        Inverts the deformation transformation.

@Limitations
    Currently the operator does a simple linear interpolation between the original and the transformed points. This is fast
    but the results are poor when heavy rotations needed.
