"""Creation/manipulation of per-point float attributes using a series of basic operations."""

@Parameters
    Attribute:
        Name of the attribute to create or modify.

    Local Variable:
        Name of the local variable that will be associated with the attribute.

    Geometry:
        Pre-processing of input geometry.

        No Change:
            Use the input geometry as-is.

        Keep Points Only:
            Delete all except point data from the geometry.
            This can be useful if the geometry is heavy and the results are only intended to be used
            in another PointAttr qL SOP as secondary geometry.

    Operations:
        A series of operations where the attribute can be created or imported, then adjusted in various ways
        to achieve the desired result.

        The following operations are available:

        '---' (Off):
            No operation.

        _'Get'_:
            Import another attribute -- copy the incoming values to the attribute being edited.
            (The imported values will be converted to `float` type.)

            Attribute Name:
                Name of the attribute to import.

                Type:
                    Original type of the imported attribute (and how to convert to `float`, if applicable).

                Input:
                    The geometry to import the attribute from (ie. connected to the first or second input).

        _'Set'_:
            Generate attribute values. The following modes are available:

            Constant Value:
                All values will be initialized to the same value.

            Random Range \[0..1\]:
                A random value in the `\[0..1\]` range will be set for each point.
                (Use a *Fit* operation to stretch this to an arbitrary range.)

            Point Index \[0..pts#):
                The corresponding geometry point index will be copied to each value.

            Point Index \[0..1\]:
                Same as above, but the indices are normalized into the unit range.

            Point ID, Age, Life, Lifespan:
                The POP/particle-related attribute will be used.

        _'Fit'_:
            Apply a [Fit Range|Node:vop/fit] operation on the attribute values
            (values in the 'source' range will be mapped to the 'destination' range).

            Values out of the range min/max settings are clamped (this can be used
            as a side effect).

        _'Tune'_:
            Adjust all attribute values.
            The `Value` parameter is used wherever it makes sense.

            Add:
                Increment attribute values by `Value`.

            Multiply:
                Multiply all values by `Value`.

            Power (Gamma):
                Apply a gamma-correction with `Value`.

            Complement (Invert):
                Calculates `1.0-attr`.

            Modulo:
                Divides with `Value` and stores the remainder of the divide.

            Randomize:
                Generates (pseudo)random values using current attribute values as input.
                The `Value` parameter is used as random seed.

            Add then Floor:
                Rounds down the attribute values to the nearest integer but adds `Value`
                first (regular rounding can be applied using `0.5` for `Value`).
                


        _'Map'_:
            Remap attribute values using a lookup curve
            (similar to [Attr Lookups qL|Node:sop/attr_lookups_ql] or the [Lookup CHOP|Node:chop/lookup]).
