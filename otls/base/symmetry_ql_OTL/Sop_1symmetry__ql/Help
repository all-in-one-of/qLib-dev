"""Mirrors the shape of a geometry based on topological symmetry, leaving original topology and existing attributes intact."""

This operator can be used when simple deleting and mirroring is not an option because of existing assymetric attributes
or original point ordering would be lost during the process.

TIP:
    Use [Node:sop/attribmirror] instead of this operator if you want to mirror attributes by positional proximity
    instead of topologic matching.

TIP:
    You can mirror attributes on assymetrically shaped but topologically symmetrical geometry with the combination of
    this operator, [Node:sop/attribmirror], and [Node:sop/attribcopy].

@Inputs
    Input Geo:
        The geometry you want to make symmetric.
    Reference Geo:
        The symmetric reference geometry used by the "Reference" mode.

@Parameters
    Group:
        Group of points that the operator affects.
    Axis:
        The axis of mirroring.
    Opposite:
        Flips the direction of mirroring to negative side to positive side.
    Center:
        The center of the symmetry.
    Mode:
        The mode of operation.

        Match Topology:
            If the topology of the two sides of the symmetry plane exactly matches, this mode can automatically pair
            matching points of the two sides.
        Reference:
            If only the shape of the sides and not the topology matches (for example a revolved surface) you have
            to provide a symmetric version of the geometry to the "Reference Geo" input. This mode will use this
            reference geometry to pair the points of the sides.
    Tracking Points:
        In "Match Topology" mode, if the sides don't have enough topologic detail, you may have to provide some hints
        in the form of paired points to the matching algorithm. This parameter holds the points of one side.
    Reference Points:
        This parameter holds the matching points listed in "Tracking Points" from the other side. The order of the points
        in the list is important to match.
