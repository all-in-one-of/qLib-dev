*version 1*

"""A VOP POP implementation of the regular [Force POP|Node:pop/force]."""

This node is the same as the regular [Node:pop/force], except that it is implemented as a VOP POP,
so it should scale to multiple processors.

NOTE:
    Noise implementation _does_ differ from the original [Force POP|Node:pop/force] -- do not expect
    identical results for identical noise parameters.
