*Version 0.1.0*

"""Interpolates points of two shapes along a circular arc."""

The main purpose of this node is to allow proper blending of the eyelid around the eyeball.

NOTE:
    If the distance of the two states of a point is not equal from the center the operator will lineary interpolate
    the distance which causes the track of the point to be an imperfect circular arc.

@Parameters
    Group:
        The group of points the operator affects.
    Bias:
        The bias of the blend.
    Center:
        The point around the blend occures.
    Cylindrical:
        The blends occurs around a line instead of a single point.
    Axis:
        The direction of the blend axis.

    Version 0.2.0:
        Cylindrical blend implemented. Also added some guide geometry and transform handles.

    Version 0.1.0:
