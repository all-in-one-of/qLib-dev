*Version 0.1.0*

"""Triangulates surfaces."""

@Parameters
    Maximum Area:
        The maximum desired area of a triangle.
    Minimum Angle:
        The smallest acceptable angle in a triangle.
    Edge Refine Length:
        The segment length edges are refined to.

        NOTE: 
        Edges are refined in a separate step before the surface triangulation. While the default value will
        work for most scenarios, you can adjust it if you experience that some points are not connected on
        the original edges.

@Limitations
    It's a hack. Don't expect much. It's good for tesselate large polygons, but gives poor results if applied
    on already tesselated geometry. Since it uses Cloth Refine inside, all the problems of that op is inherited.

    While it saves normals and uvs, rest positions and material assignments are destroyed. Apply them after this
    node.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
