@parameters
    Mode:
        How to fit the input geometry within the bounds of the secondary geometry.

        Fit into Box:
            Apply a non-proportional scaling to the input geometry to fit within bounds.

        Clamp to Box Bounds:
            Clamp the coordinates of each point to be fall within bounds range.

            NOTE:
                This mode can be useful for geometry with pieces that 'fell' too far
                (e.g. when trying to add smoke effects to an RBD simulation, where
                a few RBD pieces fell through the floor or were shot towards 'infinity').

    Padding:
        Extra padding distance along the three world axes.
