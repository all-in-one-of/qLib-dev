= Weighted Transform qL =

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Transforms points weighted by an attribute on the geometry."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        Points that get affected.
    Weight Attribute:
        Name of the point attribute that masks the transforms.
    Envelope:
        Global envelope.
    Transform Parameters:
        Usual stuff.        

@Limitations
    Currently the operator does a simple linear interpolation between the original and the transformed points. This is fast
    but the results are poor when heavy rotations needed.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
