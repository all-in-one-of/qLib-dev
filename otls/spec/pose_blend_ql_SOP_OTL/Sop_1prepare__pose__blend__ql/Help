= Prepare Pose Blend qL =

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Prepare a goal shape for the Pose Blend qL operation."""

This node calculates the difference between two geometries along quaternions defined for each point. The quaternion
attribute must be present on the second input. The result is stored in P, so the output will be ugly, and it's probably
useless without a [Node:sop/pose_blend_ql] node.

This node works in tandem with the [Node:sop/pose_blend_ql] operator. Please read the documentation for that node to
understand the usage context of this node.

@Parameters
    Quaternion Attribute:
        The name of the quaternion attribute.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
