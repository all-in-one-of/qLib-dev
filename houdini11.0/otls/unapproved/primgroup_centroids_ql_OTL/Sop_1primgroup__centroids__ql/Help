PrimGroup Centroids qL


Builds a point cloud, where each point represents a centroid of a primitive group.

Useful for generating center points for fractured geometry pieces.

It also supports generation of convenience attributes, which allow easy mapping between
group names and point indices (in both directions -- index-to-name and name-to-index lookup).



NOTE: group order and centroid-pt (ie. output) order ALWAYS match -- if you find otherwise,
please report as a BUG.
