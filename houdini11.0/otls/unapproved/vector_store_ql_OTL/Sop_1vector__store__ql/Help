*Version 0.0.1*

"""Converts vector attributes to points (and vice versa), allowing any deforming SOP to work on vector attributes."""

This SOP converts specified per-point vector attributes to actual geometry points, where each point will be created
where the original vector 'pointed at'. For each per-point vector turned into such a point cloud, a special point
group is created to allow converting back to attributes.

Two modes are supported -- Save and Restore --, where Save converts vector attributes to 'point clouds' with point groups,
and Restore is for the opposite (based on the point groups, it converts the point positions to vector attributes, then
deletes the extra points).

@Usage
    This SOP is a general-purpose 'workaround': there are some SOP nodes than apply deformations to geometry, but apart
    from adjusting the points, they don't update vector attributes (such as normals, up vectors, etc).

    With this SOP, attributes can be converted to points before applying such deformations, and 'restored' afterwards.
    Use this node in Save mode _before_ the deformations, and a copy of the node in Restore settings _after_ the deform
    SOPs, and volia--all vector attributes behave accordingly (including custom ones).

NOTE:
    This SOP replaces for the __Orient Save qL__ and __Orient Restore qL__ SOPs (those are considered obsolete).


@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the deformer affects.
    Operation:
        The operation to be executed.
    Blend:
        The mix bias when the operation is mix.
