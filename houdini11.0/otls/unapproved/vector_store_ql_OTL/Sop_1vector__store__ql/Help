"""Converts vector attributes to points (and vice versa), allowing any deforming SOP to work on vector attributes."""

This SOP converts specified per-point vector attributes to actual geometry points, where each point will be created
where the original vector 'pointed at'. For each per-point vector turned into such a point cloud, a special point
group is created to allow converting back to attributes.

Two modes are supported -- Save and Restore --, where Save converts vector attributes to 'point clouds' with point groups,
and Restore is for the opposite (based on the point groups, it converts the point positions to vector attributes, then
deletes the extra points).

@Usage
    This SOP is a general-purpose 'workaround': there are some SOP nodes than apply deformations to geometry, but apart
    from adjusting the points, they don't update vector attributes (such as normals, up vectors, etc).

    With this SOP, attributes can be converted to points before applying such deformations, and 'restored' afterwards.
    Use this node in Save mode _before_ the deformations, and a copy of the node in Restore settings _after_ the deform
    SOPs, and volia--all vector attributes behave accordingly (including custom ones).

NOTE:
    This SOP replaces for the __Orient Save qL__ and __Orient Restore qL__ SOPs (those are considered obsolete).


@Parameters
Common:
    Mode:
        Operation mode -- __Save__ converts vector attributes to points, __Restore__ does the opposite.
    Vector Attributes:
        The vector attributes to work with.
    Group Prefix:
        This OP creates point groups for each point-cloud created from an attribute. The group names are
        the attribute names prefixed with this parameter.
    Length Multiplier:
        This number is used to specify the length of an unit vector when stored (ie. if the value is 0.1, the vector's
        point will be at a distance of 0.1 from the original point for an unit-length vector). The same value should
        be specified for both the __Save__ and __Restore__ OPs.

        If you use high-frequency deformations and not getting the vector results as you expect, try to modify this value
        (usually decrease).

        To visualize, enable 'points' display in the viewport, and adjust this parameter while watching the output
        of a Vector Store SOP in Save mode.
Save:
    Delete Source Attributes:
        Once the vector attributes are represented as points, the attributes themselved will be deleted.
        (This is for memory efficiency -- also, the generated points would have the same attributes as well,
        which is kind of meaningless.)
Restore:
    Normalize Vectors:
        Normalize lengths of the restored vectors (ie. all vector lengths will be unit size).
    Output Length Mult:
        An additional (and optional) multiplier which can be used to scale vector lengths after restore.
        (This is applied after normalization.)


NOTE:
    You needn't restore all attributes you saved -- but a __Restore__ operation will remove all the extra points
    and groups, not just the ones you restored (this is an intentional behaviour).
