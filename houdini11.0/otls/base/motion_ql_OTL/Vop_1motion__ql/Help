= Motion qL =

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Calculates pixel motions in different spaces."""

TIP:
    The convenience shader Motion qL can be used to export motion vectors to the color plane.

TIP:
    To render a motion pass:
        # set the desired shutter speed on the camera
        # turn on the *Allow Motion Blur* toggle on the ROP
        # add (if it's not already there) and turn off the *Allow Image Motion Blur* toggle on the ROP
        # Set pixel filter to either *minmax ocover* (Object With Most Pixel Coverage) or *minmax min* (closet sample filtering)

@Parameters
    Mode:
        Motion qL supports three modes:
            * 2D (pixel): movements in image space in pixels.
            * 2D (NDC): movements in image space in normalized device coordinates.
            * 3D: movements in 3D.
