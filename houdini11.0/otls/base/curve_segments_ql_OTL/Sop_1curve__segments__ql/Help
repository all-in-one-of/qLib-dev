*Version 0.2.0*

"""Creates separate primitive for each poly curve segment."""

@Limitations
    Works with polygonal curves only.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.2.0:
        A faster and cleaner rewrite of the original functionality.

        NOTE:
            While the primitive order is the same, the output is not identical, since this version
            does not introduce new points in the geometry, only the primitives. (But this is how it should work :)

    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
