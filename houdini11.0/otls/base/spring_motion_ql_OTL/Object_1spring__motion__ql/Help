*Version 0.1.0*

"""Applies spring like lag and overshoot to the position of a transform."""

@Parameters
    Blend:
        Contribution of the spring motion to the original.
    Spring Constant:
        Spring constant of the spring.
    Mass:
        Mass of the imaginary object attached to the spring.
    Damping Constant:
        Damping of the spring.

@Limitations
    Animating the "Spring Constant", "Mass" and "Damping Constant" parameters slows the node considerably. Animating
    the blend parameter doesn't causes such a slowdown.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
