= Orient Save qL =

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Saves Up and Norm vectors to point groups to allow geometry deformations to affect them correctly."""

This node works in tandem with Orient Restore qL. Between the two nodes there will be additional points in the
geometry, so you will want to put Orient Restore qL immediately after you finished deformations on your geometry.

@Parameters
    Save Up:
        Save the up vectors.
    Up Group Name:
        Name of the point group where Up vectors gets stored.
    Save Normal:
        Save the normal vectors.

        TIP:
            You need to save normals if they are different from normals derived from the geometry, since deformations
            usually updates normals.
    Normal Geoup Name:
        Name of the point group where Up vectors gets stored.
