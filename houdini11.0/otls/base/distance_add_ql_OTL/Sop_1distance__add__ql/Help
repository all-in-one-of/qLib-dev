= Distance Add qL =

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Adds edges and faces between points based on their distance from each other."""

TIP:
    You can use this asset to build the inner scaffolding of soft bodies and Cloth objects.

@Parameters
    Group:
        The group of points that gets connected.
    Connect Others:
        Connect points outside of Group to points inside of Group.

        TIP:
            Use this option to connect the inner "scaffolding" to the actual visible surface.
    Create Edges:
        Create zero area polygons between the points.
    Create Faces:
        Create faces for point triplets that all has generated edges.

        NOTE:
            The asset doesn't checks overlapping, so your initial point data should be prepared well
            to avoid overlaping faces. For example it's easy to get overlapping faces with more than three
            close enough points in the same plane.
    Maximum Length:
        The maximum distance between points that gets connected.
    Mminimum Length:
        The minimum distance between points that gets connected.

@Limitations
    This thing is slow.
    
    TIP:
        Increase Maximum Length slowly and check the result. A slight bum in Maximum Length can result in
        sever slowdown and lots of edges. Also use Create Edges first and only switch Create Faces when you
        see the desired edge structure.

    Max and Min length should be also defined by point attributes, which would make this asset much more
    flexible. This is not implemented yet.
