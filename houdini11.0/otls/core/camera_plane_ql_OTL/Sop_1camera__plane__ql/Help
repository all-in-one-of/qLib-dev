*Version 0.0.1*

"""Creates a plane that fills the screen of a given camera."""

== Attributes ==

The resulting plane has several attributes that can be helpful later:

rest:
    contains the positions of the base grid, the full uncropped grid one unit distance from the camera.
    This is always in camera space.

uv:
    the UV coordinates of the plane, cropped properly if a crop is applied.

N:
    points away from the camera, so it can be used to project the geometry to some other geometry while maintaining
    the screen filling properties of the grid.

@Parameters
    Camera:
        The camera that the plane belongs to.
    Space:
        The space that the plane is generated into.
        
        NOTE:
            If you choose camera space you will probably want to parent the container object to your camera object.
    Plane Distance:
        The distance of the plane from the camera.
    Overscan X/Y:
        Scale factor in screen space.
    Use Camera Crop:
        Use the corresponding camera's crop settings to crop the plane.
    Crop Left/Right/Bottom/Top:
        Crop settings if 'Use Camera Crop' not active.
    Geometry Tab:
        Everything corresponds to the matching parameters of the Grid SOP.
    Export UV:
        Generate UV coordinates.
    Apply Material:
        Applies a basic constant material.
    Texture:
        Name of the texture file.
