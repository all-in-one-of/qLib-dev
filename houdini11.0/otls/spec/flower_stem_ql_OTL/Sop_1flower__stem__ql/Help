"""High-level asset for creating growing flowers (stem, with leaves and head)."""

(Alpha version)

This node takes a flower head geometry (optional) and a stem curve to build a flower. The node result is
not a complete flower however, but a 'skeleton' geometry, which can be used to construct a final flower.

The skeleton geometry contains
- The flower head, placed at the end of the stem curve
- The stem curve
 - Clipped using the Growth parameter
 - Containing a per-point pscale attribute to be used as stem geometry profile
- Leaf points along the stem curve (with per-point pscale attribute for growth-adjusted leaf sizes)



@Inputs
Flower Head Geometry:
    The geometry representing the flower's head. It will be placed appropriately at the end of the stem curve.

Stem Curve:
    The curve representing the flower's stem.


@Parameters
Head Group, Stem Group, Leaves Group:
    Names of the groups in the output geometry that will contain the various parts.

Growth U:
    This parameter adjusts the 'growth' along the stem curve (0 results in no geometry output and 1 in a full-grown flower).
