*Version 0.0.1*

"""Turns all edges of a polymesh to linear curves."""

This SOP is a convenient addition to the Wire (Wireframe) and PolyWire types of nodes.
It converts all polymesh edges to degree-1 (linear) curves.

@Parameters

    Fuse Results:
        Enable this to have shared points for all the resulting curves.
        (By default, all resulting curves have unique points.)

    Distance:
        Tolerance for the fuse operation.

    Maintain Point Order:
        _Try_ to maintain the same point order as the input polymesh. Can be useful
        for copying point positions from the original mesh (for animation purposes, etc.)

        It's a good idea to enable Fuse Results (see above).

        NOTE:
            It's not always possible to maintain the exact same point order (especially
            if the original mesh had un-fused but coincident points).
            
            In case point orders don't match up, try applying a Fuse SOP to the original polymesh.
