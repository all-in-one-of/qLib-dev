= Match Points Order qL =

*Version 0.0.1*

"""Tries to match point order of a geometry by using the order from a 2nd (reference) geometry."""


NOTE:
    It's not always possible to maintain the exact same point order (for instance
    if the original geometry had un-fused but coincident points).
    
    In case point orders don't match up, try applying a Fuse SOP to the original geometry,
    and/or the reference geometry as well.
