= Match Points Order qL =

*Version 0.0.1*

"""Tries to match point order of a geometry by using the order from a 2nd (reference) geometry."""

The function of this SOP is to try to copy the point order from a reference geometry to its primary input
geometry.

The two inputs should have the same exact topology (at least the same number of points).

The operation will _not_ work if either geometry has overlapping/conicident points that are
not [Fused|Node:sop/fuse] first.


NOTE:
    It's not always possible to maintain the exact same point order (for instance
    if the original geometry had un-fused but coincident points).
    
    In case point orders don't match up, try applying a Fuse SOP to the original geometry,
    and/or the reference geometry as well.

@Parameters

    Apply Match:
        Enable the matching of the two geometry.

        Disabling this can be useful if the two geometry are matched some other way, and
        this SOP has to do the only the testing of the results.

    Geometry Point Counts:
        Read-only indicators of the number of points in the input and reference geometry.
        *These counts should match up exactly.*

    Test Shape Blend:
        Amount of blending between the input geometry and the SOP result. (It is shown as
        a guide geometry when the SOP is displayed). The results are okay if *the guide
        wireframe* (blue by default) *matches the reference geometry exactly, regardless of
        the blend value.*
