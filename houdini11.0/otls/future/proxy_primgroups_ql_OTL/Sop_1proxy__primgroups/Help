Creates a proxy version of each primitive group by wrapping a low resolution poly sphere/box around them.

Useful for (and designed to) replace higher-resolution geometry fractures in RBD simulations,
if the results doesn't have to be too accurate (e.g. lots of fast-moving debris).

By default all per-primitive and per-point attributes are transferred to the proxies and
the appropriate geometry groups are recreated.

The resulting groups can be used in DOP networks and their results can be imported back with
the usual DOP Import SOP node.

(TODO: create an example scene and make sure prim groups are in proper order, etc. --
in other words, do a test round.)
