= Labyrinth qL =

"""Builds a labyrinth shape from polylines on the horizontal plane."""


This is a very simple and fun 'primitive'.

The created labyrinth has no closed areas: a way can always be found between two places within
the labyrinth.

The node doesn't provide entry/exit openings (on the outer walls), cutting them is left for
the user to do. (As of the property mentioned above, the entry/exit can be placed anywhere
on the outer walls, with no restrictions.)
