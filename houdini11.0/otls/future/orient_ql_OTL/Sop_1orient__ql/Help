*Version 0.0.1*

"""Converts between different representations of per-point orientation (or per-point rotation)."""

@Parameters
    Operation:
        Conversion from two vectors to quaternion, or vice versa.
    Aim Vector:
        Attribute representing the main aim direction for each point.
    Up Vector:
        Attribute of the up direction vector for each point.
    Orient Attribute:
        Attribute representing per-point orientation as a quaternion.

@Limitations
    When converting from Orient to Aim/Up, the resulting Aim vector will always be written
    as a per-point N (normal), too.
