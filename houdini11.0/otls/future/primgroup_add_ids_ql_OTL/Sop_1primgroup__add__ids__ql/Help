"""Creates the per-primitive piece ID attribute for geometry pieces (PrimGroup family SOP)."""

Takes an input geometry with primitive ('piece') groups, assigns an unique ID for each group, then
creates a per-primitive attribute that stores this ID for all primitives.

This SOP creates the same `__origpt` attribute that is created by the [Node:sop/voronoifracture] node,
for other SOPs (such as the 'Xform by Points qL') might require this attribute.

In general, it is useful in any case where geometry is fractured/partitioned in some other way than with
the [Node:sop/voronoifracture] SOP, but a compatible geometry setup is expected (e.g. the
[Node:sop/assemble] SOP doesn't generate this attribute).

This node is usually used together with other _PrimGroup family_ SOPs -- for example, it can read the
group ID attributes from the `PrimGroup Centroids qL` SOP, and the results can be passed to the
`Xform by Points qL` SOP.

@Parameters
    Group Mask:
        Primitive groups matching this mask will be used for geometry pieces.

    Group ID Attribute:
        Name of the attribute to create. The default name is `__origpt` (to emulate the output of the
        [Node:sop/voronoifracture] SOP).

    Group IDs from:
        The way of determining the index number of each piece group.

        Group List Order:
            Index numbers are assigned incrementally for each piece group in the order they are
            considered.

        Stored Detail Attributes:
            Use a previously stored detail attribute list for determining indices for the piece groups.
            The geometry with these attributes is to be connected to the second input (if not,
            they will be looked for in the first input).

            The attributes are expected in a way where the attribute _name_ is the same as the _group name_,
            and the attribute _value_ specifies the index number (integer).
            (For more details of these attributes, see the 'PrimGroup Centroids qL' SOP help.)

        Detail Attribs (Unchecked):
            Same as the previous mode but with disabled error checking for missing groups and/or
            attributes. It _might_ be slightly faster for a very large number of pieces.

        NOTE:
            An `__origpt` index (or ID) of *`-1`* means that the source group could not be determined
            for a particular primitive. (It usually means some improper parameter settings).

    Delete Groups:
        No not retain the piece groups once the ID attributes are created.

    Delete Detail Attributes:
        If the group ID information came as detail attributes from the first input, delete those
        attributes.
