The geometry is generated in object space -- it is to be transformed to camera space to work as expected.
(e.g. parent this geometry to the specified camera.)


OUTPUT:

A grid that is an exact fit of the camera plane if it parented under the specified camera.
Attributes:
- P_screen: normalized screen coordinates
- P_scrop: see above + camera crop applied
- N: normals can be used with a Ray SOP for perspective projections
- rest: un-cropped camera plane
