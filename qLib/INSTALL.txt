Installation instructions

You should place the unpacked folder to a convenient place, where everyone
can reach it, and add the qLib/base folder to the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH
environment variable.

Dumping the otl files into a folder which contains other otls is considered bad
behavior, and will seriously and needlessly make updating the lib more
difficult.

The assets in the qLib/spec folder are intended for per-project based inclusion
(e.g. high level objects like water drops and such), so you probalbly don't
want to include that in the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH. But this decision is up to
you.
