Installation instructions

You should place the unpacked folder to a convenient place, where everyone
can reach it, and add the qLib/base folder to the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH
environment variable.

Dumping the otl files into a folder which contains other otls is considered bad
behavior, and will seriously and needlessly make updating the lib more
difficult.

In the qLib/spec folder there will be assets which are intended for per-project
based inclusion (e.g. high level objects like water drops and such), so you
probalbly don't want to include that in the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH. But this
decision is up to you.
