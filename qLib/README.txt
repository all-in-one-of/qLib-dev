v0.0.1 - Initial release.

    This is the initial release of qLib. This release doesn't include much,
    just the single motion_trail_ql asset. This release is mainly to test the
    release method and the filesystem layout.

    You should place the unpacked folder to a convenient place, where everyone
    can reach it, and add the qLib/base folder to the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH
    environment variable.

    In the qLib/spec folder there will be assets which are intended for
    per-project based inclusion (e.g. high level objects like water drops and
    such).
