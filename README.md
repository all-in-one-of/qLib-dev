qLib-dev
========

This is the development repository of qLib. We use this repository to store the
assets in ascii form, which is much better supported by Git. We can track
changes made to the assets in much greater detail with these. On the other hand
these 'blowed up' assets are not directly usable by end users.

So if you are **looking for the loadable tools** then you are in the wrong
place, and you need the repository of the
[distribution](https://github.com/qLab/qLib) or you can download them as a zip
from the [web page of qlib](http://qlab.github.com/qLib).
