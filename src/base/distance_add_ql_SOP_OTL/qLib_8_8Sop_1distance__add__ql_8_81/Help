= Distance Add qL =

*Version 0.1.0*

"""Adds edges and faces between points based on their distance from each other."""

This SOP can be used to build inner scaffolding for soft bodies or cloth objects.

@Parameters
    Group:
        The group of points that gets connected.

    Connect Others:
        Connect points outside of Group to points inside of Group.

        TIP:
            Use this option to connect the inner "scaffolding" to the actual visible surface.

    Create Edges:
        Create zero area polygons between the points.

    Create Faces:
        Create faces for point triplets that all has generated edges.

        NOTE:
            The results are not checked for overlapping.
            To avoid overlaps make sure your initial point data is prepared accordingly
            (e.g. avoid having more than three points laid roughly on the same plane).

    Maximum Length:
        The maximum distance between points that gets connected.

    Minimum Length:
        The minimum distance between points that gets connected.

@Limitations
    This thing is slow.
    
    TIP:
        Gradually increase Maximum Length in small steps and keep checking the result.
	A slight bump in Maximum Length can result in severe slowdown and lots of edges.
	Also use Create Edges first and only switch Create Faces when you see the desired edge structure.

    Max and Min length should be also defined by point attributes, which would make this asset much more
    flexible. This is not implemented yet.

@Release_Notes
    Version 0.1.0:
        Initial release.
