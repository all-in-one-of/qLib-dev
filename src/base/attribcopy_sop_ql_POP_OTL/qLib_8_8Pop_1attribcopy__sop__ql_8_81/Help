*interface version 1*

"""Copy the specified attribute from a SOP geometry to the corresponding particles."""

@Parameters
    Activation:
        ...

    Source Group:
        ...

    SOP:
        Path/name of the SOP node to copy attribute values from.

    Point Indexing:
        These parameters provide help for mapping the SOP geometry point order to the point order
        of the POP particles.

        Use Origin Attribute:
            The `origin` attribute is a per-point index: for each particle it stores the point index
            for its corresponding (source) SOP geometry point.

            The origin attribute will be used for SOP-to-POP mapping if this toggle is enabled.

        Origin Attr Name:
            Name of the aforementioned origin attribute (called `origin` by default).

        Origin Index:
            ...

    Attributes:

        Attribute Type:
            Type of the source attribute on the SOP geometry (`float`, `vector` or `vector4` type).

        Input Attribute:
            Name of the input attribute to copy from the SOP geometry.

        Output/POP Attribute:
            Name of the attribute to copy to in the POP network.

        Out Local Variable:
            Name of the local variable associated with the output (POP) attribute.
