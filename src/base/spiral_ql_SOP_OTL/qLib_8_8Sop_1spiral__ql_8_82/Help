*interface version 2*

"""Generates a spiral (with support for different variants and a backbone)."""

This SOP can generate an archimedean, logarythmic or arbitrary attribute-driven spiral.
The spiral is built either on a (world-axis aligned) linear segment or around an input ("backbone") curve.

@Parameters
    Primitive Type:
        Type of the generated geometry (polygon, NURBS, bezier, or points only).

    Axis:
        Axis of the linear line segment when no backbone connected.

    Origin:
        Origin of the generated backbone.

    Distance:
        Length of the generated backbone.

    Points:
        Number of points along the generated spiral. The following point distribution modes are available:

        at Even Angles:
            the angle along the spiral between generated points is evenly distributed.
        at Even Lengths:
            length of segments along the curve is evenly distibuted.

    Mode:
        Settings on how the spiral shape is generated.

        Number of Turns:
            The start radius and the number of turns is specified. 
        Start-End Radii:
            The start and the end radius is specified.
        NOTE:
            These parameters act as multipliers if the spiral generation is driven by attributes.

    Turns:
        Number of turns.

    Start Radius:
        The starting radius of the generated spiral.

    End Radius:
        The ending radius of the generated spiral.

    Roll:
        Roll around backbone.

    Archimedean:
        Linear Factor:
            Linear factor of the calculation.
        Exponent:
            Exponent of the angle.

    Logarithmic:
        Linear Factor:
            Linear factor of the calculation.

        Exponent Factor:
            Exponent factor of the calculation.

    Attribute:
        Use Twist Attribute (toggle):
            If turned off a simple linear progression controls the twist.

        Twist Attribute:
            Name of the point attribute driving the twist around the backbone.

        Twist Mode:
            Controls how the twist attribute gets interpreted:
            * *Relative*: attribute values are interpreted as the relative twist from the previous point.
            * *Absolute*: attribute values are interpreted as the number of turns at the given point.
            NOTE:
                In both mode the *Turn* parameter act as a multiplier in the twist calculation.

        Use Radius Attribute (toggle):
            If turned off a simple linear progression between *Start Radius* and *End Radius* controls the radius.

        Radius Attribute:
            Name of the point attribute controlling the radius of the spiral at the given point.

        Radius Mode:
            Controls how the radius attribute gets interpreted:
            * *Relative*: attribute values gets fitted between *Start Radius* and *End Radius*.
            * *Absolute*: attribute values are only multiplied by *End Radius*.
