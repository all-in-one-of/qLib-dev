*Version 2*

"""Generates an archimedean, logarythmic or arbitrary attribute driven spiral around an input curve or linear segment."""

@Parameters
    Axis:
        Axis of the linear line segment when no backbone connected.
    Origin:
        Origin of the generated backbone.
    Distance:
        Length of the generated backbone.
    Points:
        Number of points along the generated spiral.
    Even:
        Type of segment creation:
        * *Angle*: the angle along the spiral between generated points is evenly distributed.
        * *Length*: length of segments along the curve is evenly distibuted.
    Mode:
        Type of generation:
        * *Turns*: the start radius and the number of turns is specified. 
        * *Start-End*: the start and the end radius is specified.
        NOTE:
            These parameters act as multipliers if the spiral generation is driven by attributes.
    Turns:
        Number of turns.
    Start Radius:
        The starting radius of the generated spiral.
    End Radius:
        The ending radius of the generated spiral.
    Roll:
        Roll around backbone.

    Archimedean:
        Linear Factor:
            Linear factor of the calculation.
        Exponent:
            Exponent of the angle.

    Logarythmic:
        Linear Factor:
            Linear factor of the calculation.
        Exponent Factor:
            Exponent factor of the calculation.

    Attribute:
        Use Twist Attribute (toggle):
            If turned off a simple linear progression controls the twist.
        Twist Attribute:
            Name of the point attribute driving the twist around the backbone.
        Twist Mode:
            Controls how the twist attribute gets interpreted:
            * *Relative*: attribute values are interpreted as the relative twist from the previous point.
            * *Absolute*: attribute values are interpreted as the number of turns at the given point.
            NOTE:
                In both mode the *Turn* parameter act as a multiplier in the twist calculation.
        Use Radius Attribute (toggle):
            If turned off a simple linear progression between *Start Radius* and *End Radius* controls the radius.
        Radius Attribute:
            Name of the point attribute controlling the radius of the spiral at the given point.
        Radius Mode:
            Controls how the radius attribute gets interpreted:
            * *Relative*: attribute values gets fitted between *Start Radius* and *End Radius*.
            * *Absolute*: attribute values are only multiplied by *End Radius*.
