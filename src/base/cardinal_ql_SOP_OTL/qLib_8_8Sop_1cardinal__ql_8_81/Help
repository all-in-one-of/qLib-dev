Given a bunch of linear curves (or polylines), this SOP fits a cardinal-interpolated
version on each curve. The result type can be polylines or NURBS.

The distinguishing property of cardinal curves is that the resulting curve is drawn so
it touches all the control points (all control points lie on the curve -- in contrast
to NURBS, where CVs never touch the curve itself).

This makes cardinal curves less attractive for precision modeling than NURBS,
but they are very useful for more irregular but still curved shapes
(such as loose cables, strands of spiderwebs, etc).


NOTE:
    This is an alternative to the [Fit SOP|Node:sop/fit] -- although it gives somewhat different results,
    this SOP is many orders of magnitudes faster, especially on a large number of curves.

    The resulting curve(s) might have a completely different (ie. sorted) point topology
    than the source geometry.
