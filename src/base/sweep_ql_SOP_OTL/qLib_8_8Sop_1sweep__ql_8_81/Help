*version 1*

"""Creates a surface by sweeping cross-sections along a backbone curve with ramp parameters controling scale and twist."""

This node is a replacement of the original [Sweep SOP|Node:sop/sweep], providing additional features,
such as reversing input curve directions, refining of the path curve, scale/twist/roll driven by per-point
attributes and/or ramp controls, and basic UV coordinate generation.

@Parameters
    Sweep:
        See the [Node:sop/sweep] documentation for parameters.
        Additional parameters are described below.

        Backbone Refine:
            The number of divisions to create along the path spline (if enabled).

            This can be useful if the resulting surface doesn't follow the path curve
            accurately enough (might happen with path curves with points placed
            too un-evenly along the curve).

        Reverse Cross Section(s), Reverse Backbone:
            Reverse the direction of the profile and/or path curve(s).

            (e.g.: if the surface normals of the resulting geometry point inwards, reverse cross-section curve direction.)

        Scale:
            Scale Multiplier:
                Global scale multiplier for profile scale.
        
            Profile Scale:
                Modulates the profile along the backbone, default is 1.

        Twist:        
            Twist Multiplier:
                Multiplyer of the _Profile Twist_ parameter in degrees.
        
            Profile Twist:
                Modulates the twist parameter along the backbone, default is 0 (no twist).

    Output:
        Add Texture UVs:
            A quick convenience switch to generate basic UV coordinates for the resulting surface.

            NOTE:
                It is geared towards working with parametric-type geometry, so make sure all inputs
                are of that type (NURBS curves, etc.)

                Also, make sure the _Cycle Type_ parameter is set to a mode that supports UV generation
                (marked with `*` in the UI).

        Cross Section(s), Backbone:
            Parametrization setting for UV coordinates generation for the cross section and backbone curves.
            (See the [UV Texture SOP|Node:sop/texture] for description.)

            NOTE:
                The _Arc Length Spline_ mode can cause some "swimming" of the texture for animated path geometry.

TIP:
    To have proper UV texturing coordinates, do the following:
    - Assign UVs to the backbone spline using an [Node:sop/texture], SOP (using one of its _Spline_ modes)
    - Assign UVs to the cross section curve(s) the same way, but rotate the UVs by `-90` degrees.
    - Set _Cycle Type_ to "One Primitive at a Time" (or "Cycle Primitives").
