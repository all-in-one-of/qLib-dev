*interface version 1*

"""An alternative version of the Box SOP, with differently-fashioned parameters."""

The following are the differences from the original [Node:sop/box] SOP:

* The box is specified by two opposite corner points (face normals will always point outwards, regardless of corner positions).
* It also allows removing specified sides of the box.
* It provides two ways of specifying divisions.


NOTE:
    This SOP generates polygonal geometry only.
