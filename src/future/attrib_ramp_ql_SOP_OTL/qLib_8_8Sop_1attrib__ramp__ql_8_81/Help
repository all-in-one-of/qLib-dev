*interface version 1*

"""Creates a new attribute by mapping a point attribute to a ramp."""

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the operator affects.

    Input Attribute:
        Name of the attribute that drives the mapping.

    Signature, Component:
        Signature of the output attribute (float, vector, integer), and
        component for vector attributes (X, Y, Z, length).

    Input Min, Max:
        Minimum and maximum values of the input that fit to the start end end of the ramp.

        By pressing the `Get` button the corresponding (min/max) value will be determined
        from the actual attribute values, and it will be written into the parameter field.

        If a value field is disabled, its value will be determined automatically from the
        attribute values. (These min/max calculations are redone whenever the input attributes
        change.)

    Output:
        Name of the attribute that stores the result of the mapping.

    Operation:
        Type of operation. The original value of the output attribute can be *added*, *multiplied* or be *replaced*
        with the result.

    Color Mode:
        Color mode of the ramp.
    Ramp:
        The ramp that gets mapped.
    Exponent:
        Exponent of a power operation that allows you to make a gamma correction of the output.


@todo Todo
    - Out-of-range mapping (keep, repeat, output-black (?)).
