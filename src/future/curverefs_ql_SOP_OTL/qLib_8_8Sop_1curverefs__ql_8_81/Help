This SOP generates reference frames (a set of three vectors that defines a local coordinate system)
for all curve points.

The algorithm generates each reference frame incrementally from the previous one to avoid flipping.
This can be very useful where curves with 'on-curve orientation' information is needed
(such as motion paths or hair curves).

The method is based on the paper "Calculation of Reference Frames along a Space Curve" by Jules Bloomenthal
(Graphics Gems, vol. 1).

NOTE:
    This node *requires UV mapping* to be present on the curve.

    The operator gives much better results for polygonal curves (although it accepts other curve types).
    A properly [resampled poly curve|Node:sop/resample] with enough points is preferred.


TIP:
    Although there won't be sudden "flips" in vector directions along the curve,
    the algorithm can be sensitive about the initial up vector direction, especially
    if the curve is arbitrarily deformed.

    To avoid possible flipping of vectors on the _entire curve_, generate an up vector
    on the first curve point that has no sudden changes during animation, and use the
    "*Up Vector from First Curve Point*" option for _Up Vector Mode_.

    (This only applies for animated/deformed curves. It also doesn't matter in case
    only the tangent vectors are used.)

@Parameters
    Input:
        UV Attribute:
            A per-point UV attribute to build the reference frames from (only the U parameter is used).
            This attribute must be present (can be generated with an [Node:sop/texture] SOP).
    
        Up Vector Mode:
            The mode for determining the first up vector on each curve. It can either be a constant,
            or the up vector value of the first vertex can be used (if present).

            Make sure you read the TIP above.

        Up Vector:
            Vector value for the 'Constant' up vector mode.

    Output:
        Tangent:
            Name of the output tangent attribute (per-point vector).
        Normal:
            Name of the output normal (bi-tangent) attribute (per-point vector).
        Up:
            Name of the output up vector attribute (per-point vector).

TODO:
    Support selection ('group' parameter).
