"""Convenience SOP node for saving and restoring rest position attributes."""

@related
    - [Node:sop/rest]

This node has the same function as the original [Node:sop/rest] SOP, as well as
restoring (and swapping) rest positions and normals (`rest`, `nrml` per-point attributes).


@parameters
    Mode:
        Save:
            Save rest position attribute for geometry.
            See the [Node:sop/rest] SOP for parameter details.

        Restore:
            Restore per-point rest positions.

            Point Group:
                Rest positions are only restored for the given points, if specified.

            Blend:
                A position/rest blend percentage value, where `0.0` keeps the original point
                positions and `1.0` fully restores rest positions.

            Restore Mode:
                Specify what to restore: rest positions, rest normals, or both.

            Delete Rest Position Attribute:
                If enabled, the `rest` attribute will be deleted after restoring it to point positions.

            Delete Rest Normal Attribute:
                If enabled, the `rnml` attribute will be deleted after restoring it to point normals.

        Swap:
            Swaps per-point rest and current position attribute values.

            Swap Positions:
                Swap `P` and `rest` attribute values (switch not implemented; enabled by default).

            Swap Normals:
                Swap `N` and `rnml` attribute values (switch not implemented; _disabled_ by default).
