*Interface Version 1*

"""Rotates a vector attribute around another vector."""

@Description
    Rotates a vector around another vector. The axis vector and the angle can come from an attribute
    or a parameter.

@Parameters
    Point Group:
        The group of points the operator affects.
    Vector To Rotate:
        Name of the vector attribute that gets rotated.
    Axis Mode:
        Wether the axis vector is specified by a parameter or an attribute.
    Axis:
        The vector around the rotation occures. This is only active if *Axis Mode* is set to _Constant_.
    Axis Attribute:
        Name of the vector attribute that specifies the axis of rotation. This is only active if *Axis Mode*
        is set to _Attribute_.
    Angle Mode:
        Wether the angle is specified by a parameter, an attribute or an expression.
    Angle Unit:
        Wether the angle value is in degrees or radians.
    Angle:
        The amount of rotation. This is only active if *Angle Mode* is set to _Constant_.
    Anlge Attribute:
        The name of the float attribute that specifies the amount of rotation. This is only active if
        *Angle Mode* is set to _Attribute_.
    Angle Expression:
        Evaluates the given string as an expression.
        
        WARNING:
            The given expression is evaluated by an AttribCreate node inside the asset. Because of this
            you should add an extra "../" to your relative operator paths. For the same reasons the
            the expression highlighting won't recognise all usable local variables. See the helpcard of
            [Attrib Create|Node:sop/attribcreate#locals] to find usable local variables.
