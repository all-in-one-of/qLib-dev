*Version 0.1.1*

"""Replaces points (i.e. corners) with circular arcs in polygonal curves."""

@Parameters
    Group:
        The group of points or primitives that gets affected by the operation.

    Group Type:
        Type of the group (point or primitive).

    Radius:
        Radius of the arc.

    Radius Attribute:
        Name of a per-component attribute that sets the radius. (It can be
        either per-point or per-primitive class, and of type `float`).

    Segment Mode:
        Segment length calculation mode.

        Max Segment Length:
            The maximum length of an individual segment for all arcs
            (i.e. corners with larger radii will have more segments).

        Number of Segments:
            Each arc will have the same number of segments.

    Max Segment Length:
        Maximum length of a segment (for _Max Segment Length_ mode).

    Segments:
        Number of segments (in _Number of Segments_ mode).

    Min/Max Angle:
        If enabled, only corners with angles between these limits will get rounded.
