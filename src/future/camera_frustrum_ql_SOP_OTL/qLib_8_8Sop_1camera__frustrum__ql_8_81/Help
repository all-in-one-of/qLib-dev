NOTE:
    This node is built from [Camera Plane qL|Node:sop/camera_plane_ql] surface nodes.



@Parameters

    Camera:
        The camera to build the frustrum geometry for.

    Space:
        See the help page for [Camera Plane qL SOP|Node:sop/camera_plane_ql] on coordinate spaces.

    Near/Far Clipping:
        Clipping plane settings can be used from the camera (default), or can be overridden
        here (separately for each plane).

    Display:
        Frustrum display options.

        Colors, Frustum/Center Color:
            Apply colors to the results.

        Shaded Mode:
            Allow lighting. (Disabling this will result in constant viewport shading, regardless of
            any viewport light settings.)

        Solid:
            Use solid (polygonal) geometry for the frustrum sides instead of the default wireframe lines.

        Center Scale:
            Size of the locator that marks the frustum apex (the location of the camera).

        Inset:
            An inset value for `Solid` frustrum sides.
