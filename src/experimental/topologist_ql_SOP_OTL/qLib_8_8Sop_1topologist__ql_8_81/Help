"""A semi-interactive node for finding incorrect geometry source(s) in a SOP graph."""

NOTE:
    Currently only polygon validity checks are implemented.


This node allows finding upstream SOP node(s) that generate invalid or undesirable geometry.

The upstream SOP graph can be traversed using the _Up_/_Dn_ buttons. The name and status
of the currently diagnosed node are displayed. Based on the status feedback the node can
be marked (_valid_ or _invalid_).


TODO:
    It should detect temporal changes in upstream geometry topology.
