*Version 0.0.2*

"""Scatters points on the motion trail of a geometry (for particle/fluid emission)."""

This node is a general-purpose particle emission helper, to support artifact-less
emission from geometry. It works with all particle types (regular POP, particle fluids, etc.)

TIP:
    When used as particle fluid emitter, it is faster, more controllable, and gives more
    accurate results than the built-in (volume-based) fluid emitters (in Houdini 12.0.xxx).

    To use it with particle fluids, create the fluid emitter as usual (from the shelf),
    then the emitter SOP network replace the fluid source SOP with this node.

@parameters
    Scatter:

        Num Points Scale %:
            This value acts as a multiplier on the number of scattered points.
            It can be used to apply gradual changes to particle emission amounts.

            NOTE:
                Use this value for animating emission (this is explicitly designed for that purpose).
                Do *not* animate the _Number of Points_ parameter.

        Exponent:
            An additional exponent value applied to the multiplier. (The default value of `2`
            results of linear changes to the above parameter to appear linear "visually".)

        See the [Scatter SOP|Node:sop/scatter] help for other parameter descriptions.

        (Note taht for deforming geometry it's usually better to turn off
        _Scatter Based on Primitive Area_.)


    Interpolator:

        DOP Sub Steps:
            Substep (or oversampling) setting of the related DOP (or POP) simulation.
            Make sure the values match (the easiest way of it is to link the DOP or POP
            network's _Substep_ or _Oversampling_ value to this parameter).

        FPS, Time:
            The current frames-per-second settings and the current time to pass along to
            the interpolation function. Usually there's no need to touch these.

        Add Particle System:
            Creates the resulting points as a particle system. This is required for particle
            fluids (for the DOP network emitter).

pros:
- emission from the generated point cloud gives gap-free emitted particles;
- calulates velocity vectors both for obj and sop level transformations;
- it is faster and more accurate fluid emitter than the built-in one;

practical


cons/bugs:
- (FIXED) animated 'seed' value is not yet supported
- (FIXED) forwards/backwards get screwed up at substep 5, 10, (...)
    - 'fix': hackety-hack at world_space/emitter_source_worldspace/slice param
        - should be okay up to about 20 substeps ( blame floating point! :( )


TODO:
- jitter points along resulting velocity vectors
- make sure emitter velocity has the same magnitude, independent of any substep settings (i think its ok)
- velocity scale parameters should work in the negative range as well
