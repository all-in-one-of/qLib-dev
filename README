qLib
====

A general purpose Digital Asset library for Houdini.


Installation instructions
=========================

Download and unpack the distribution tarball from the download section:
https://github.com/gadfly16/qLib/downloads . Note that the git repository stores
the assets in 'source' form which is not usable directly by Houdini. See
README.developer for instructions on building the assets from the source.

Place the unpacked folder to a convenient place - probably somewhere where
others can access it also - and add the qLib/otls/_SECTIONNAME_ (see below)
folder to the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH environment variable. Creating a variable
called QLIB can make adding the various sections a bit easier. For example the
next two lines adds all sections to the path:

    QLIB = /Users/mate/qLab/qLib/otls
    HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH = @/otls:$QLIB/base:$QLIB/future:$QLIB/core:$QLIB/spec

Dumping the OTL files into a folder which contains other OTLs is considered bad
practice: it seriously and needlessly makes updating the library more difficult.


Sections
========

There are five sections of the asset library: core, base, spec, future and
graveyard.  The assets belonging the different sections are stored in
directories with the same name.

The 'base' assets are intended to be used as building blocks of more
complex networks.

The 'core' assets are intended to be used as building blocks of 'base' level
assets. The assets in this section are usually not very useful alone, but are
needed by assets in other sections.

The 'spec' assets are intended for per-project based inclusion (e.g. high level
objects like water drops, etc.), so you probably don't want to include that
in the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH. But this decision is up to you.

The 'future' assets are not yet integrated into the main distribution. They may
lack documentation or other mandatory requirementis. We release them because
they can be useful even before they fulfill those requirements. In other words,
'future' is the alpha testing ground in the "release early, release often"
spirit.

The 'graveyard' section is the resting place for obsolete assets. We keep them
there for compatibility reasons for six month, after that they get removed from
the distribution.
