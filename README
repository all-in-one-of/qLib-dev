qLib
====

A more or less cohherent and maintained houdini asset library.


Installation instructions
=========================

You should place the unpacked folder to a convenient place, where everyone can
reach it, and add the qLib/houdini11.0/otls/SECTIONNAME (see below) folder to
the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH environment variable. Creating a variable called $QLIB
can make adding the different sections a bit easier. For example the next two
lines adds all sections to the path:

    QLIB = /Users/mate/qLab/qLib/houdini11.0/otls
    HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH = @/otls:$QLIB/base:$QLIB/future:$QLIB/core:$QLIB/spec

Dumping the otl files into a folder which contains other otls is considered bad
behavior, and will seriously and needlessly make updating the library more
difficult.


Sections
========

There are four sections of the asset library: core, base, spec, and future.
The assets belonging the different sections are stored in directories with the
same name.

The 'base' assets are intended to be used as building blocks of more
complex networks.

The 'core' assets are intended to be used as building blocks of 'base' level
assets. The assets in this section are usually not very useful alone, but are
needed by assets in other sections.

The 'spec' assets are intended for per-project based inclusion (e.g. high level
objects like water drops and such), so you probalbly don't want to include that
in the HOUDINI_OTLSCAN_PATH. But this decision is up to you.

The 'future' assets are not yet integrated into the main distribution. They
may lack documentation or other mandatory requirement to be included into the
'main' distribution or they simply need more testing. We still include them
because they can be usefull even before they fulfill those requirements.
